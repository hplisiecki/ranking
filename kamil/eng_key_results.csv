breast ptosis being related to lower attractiveness ratings and

size that the more ptotic breasts are perceived as older. Asanalyses of cross-cultural data reveal that male preferences
for female breast size and shape are variable between soci-

2.1 |Participants
The study had two parts, conducted on two different popula-
tions (Polish and Papuan), employing similar proceduresadapted to their specific conditions. All participants took partin the study anonymously, on a voluntary basis. Poland is a
country in Central Europe and is part of the European Union. The Polish sample was recruited from two cities in southernPoland (Wroc ław and Gliwice), representative of a modern
and industrialized society. It consisted of 57 women and 51
men, aged 17-78 years ( M533.6; SD 516). The second part of the study was conducted among the
Yali tribe (Papua, Indonesian province previously known asIrian Jaya). The Yali inhabit mountainous areas, east of the
Baliem valley (3.92 S, 138.73 E) from Wamena —central
part of the Baliem valley. The Yali are one of many indige-nous ethnic groups in Papua."

10-1002_ejsp-2298.pdf,Organiz,"This paper  examines  how dealing with uncertainty by adherence to religion influences 
intergroup attitudes. First, we examine  the relationship between religious beliefs  and the 
tendency to avoid uncertainty. Moreover, we test the assumption that the connection of the 
two can  lead to prejudice towards valu e-violators , but that it can also increase positive 
attitudes towards those groups whose values are consistent with the ingroup’s  values. Finally , 
for the first time , we experimentally test how, in the face of uncertainty , religious belief s 
determine attit udes towards different groups, regarding the perception of values they follow. Intolerance of Ambiguity  and Motivation to Feel Certain  
People vary in their tolerance of ambiguity  and uncertainty . Since the  early  work by 
Frenkel -Brunswik  (1948; 1949 ), the concept s of ambiguity and uncertainty have been 
discussed  in many areas of research including  organiz ational (Robertson & Swan, 2003)  and 
vocational behavior (Xu & Tracey, 2015) , education  (Sher rill, 2001) , clinical  psychology 
(Birrell, Meares, Wilkinson, & Freestone, 2011 ; Gosselin et al., 2008 ), and creativity research 
(Wang, Zhang , & Martocchio, 2011) . Following the initial definition by Frenkel -Brunswik 
(1949) most  researchers conceptualize d the intolerance of ambiguity and uncertainty as a 
personality trait (e.g. Budner , 1962 ; Furnham  & Ribchester , 1995), or at least  a cognitive 
disposition s that may influence the propensity for certain affective, cognitive, and behavioral  
reactions in response to situations that involve novelty, complexity, unfamiliarity, 
unpredictability  (Bhushan & Amal, 1986; Budner, 1962 ; McLain, 1993; McLain, 
Keffallonitis, & Armani, 2015 ). Affective reactions most often include anxiety, discomfort, 
but also dislike or anger. Such emotions in turn lead to cognitive effort  to resolve ambiguity 
and uncertainty and/or a tendency to perceive ambiguous situations in black and white terms. Finally, low tolerance for ambiguity and uncertainty can result in behavioral  consequences  
such as delayed decision making, attributional err ors, and the general avoid ance or rejecti on UNCERTAINTY AND PREJUDICE

that conspiracy theories are often spread through the internet (see HIV denial conspiracy ;

In Exper iment  1 we tested the hypothesis  that need for cognitive closure would be 
related to  relying on c onspiratorial explanati on for a  major event when  a conspiratorial 
explanation  was made salient . We focused on Poland’s agreement to offer asylum to refugees 
from Syria and Eritrea  as a part of the European Union relocation and resettlement 
programme . This decision likely caused uncertainty among Polish residents . Ethnically , 
Poland is a very homogenous country  which often  result s in negative attitudes toward 
foreigners  who do not share Poli sh traditions . According to  the results of a  survey conducted  
by one of the leading Polish public opinion research institutions, 78% of Poles linked 
refugees arrival to reduced levels of safety, and only 5% declared that Poland should  comply 
with EU directives  and allow ref ugees to settle in Poland  (CBOS, 2015). Also, political 
rhetoric on the refugee crisis strengthened the feelings of  uncertainty  among people living in 
Poland . For example, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, leader of Poland's ruling  Law and Justice  Party, 
claimed that refugees  could bring dangerous  disease and parasites to Poland  (Goclowski,

The main purpose of Study 1 was to provide a longitudinal test of H1. We expected that, in contrast to secure national identification, nation -
ality-based collective narcissism would exert a stronger negative effect on solidarity-based engagement over time. The context was provided by the European Union (EU) refugee crisis (e.g., van Prooijen, Krouwel, & Emmer, 2018). Just as in other EU member states, Polish society be -
came divided over the strategies used to handle the influx of refugees from the Middle East and North Africa (Narkowicz, 2018). The major -
ity of Poles believe that Muslim immigrants pose a symbolic and real -
istic threat to the Polish nation and support a complete rejection of refugees—one of the first decisions of the conservative government elected in October 2015 (Bożewicz, 2018). At the same time, others call for a more welcoming policy toward refugees (Narkowicz, 2018). This is the pro-refugee mobilization that we focus on in Study 1. 2.1  | Method

The relationships between subjective status and perceived legitimacy are important for understanding 
the extent to which people with low status are complicit in their oppression."
10-1002_ejsp-2747.pdf,Fundraising,"Examples of items that were 
not selected for the study are erasers, which were assessed the least 
desirable ( M = 1.8, SD  = 1.1), and lottery coupons, which were the 
most desirable ( M = 4.1, SD  = 1.2). The boxes containing the rewards were given to the participants 
prior to the questionnaires’ completion—  this was done to increase 
the perception of the items as the participants’ property. After fill -
ing out the provided forms, the subjects left the room with their 
reward. There, a bit farther away on the corridor, a fundraiser (ex -
perimenter's assistant) asked the participants to donate something to a “Christmas box” for the social welfare center, and the quantity and type of donated items were recorded by the experimenter's as -
sistant. The experiment was seemingly unrelated to the study. It was organized before Christmas when similar actions are common at uni -
versities and various institutions and the fundraising was public—  it 
had been announced on posters at the universities many days prior 
to the study and also many random passers-  by, who did not take part 
in the questionnaire study, were invited to donate and voluntarily 
donated some goods to the welfare center. After the end of data col -
lection, we e-mailed the participants to debrief them and to uncover the real purpose of the study. They were also informed that their donations were indeed offered to the social welfare center. 3.2 | Results
Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics for Study 2. We ana -
lyzed the results by the means of the analysis of variance wherein the amount of shared items was treated as a dependent variable and condition (Food vs. Non-  Food) and sex (Men vs. Women) were 
included as the independent predictors (Li et al., 2002). The tested 
model revealed a significant, yet small, main effect of condition, F(1, 
234) = 6.33, p = .01, η
2 = 0.03, wherein Food items were shared in

texts we examined: Syrian refugees and Muslims. Syrians are the largest group of refugees worldwide, and have resettled in many countries including in Europe and, to a lesser extent, the U.S. (Pew Research Center, 2018; UNHCR, 2021). In addition to the violence suffered during the war and during resettlement, refugees are also often the target of hostility and xenophobic hate crimes in host so -
cieties (e.g., Human Rights Watch, 2016; Lueders et al., 2019). In the 
present study, we therefore focus on acceptance of Syrian refugees into one's community as a measure of prosocial attitudes towards an outgroup that is suffering due to collective violence in the present. To assess hostile attitudes towards a minority group that is targeted in the present, we examined support for surveillance of Muslims. Especially since the attacks in the U.S. on September 11, 2001 and the subsequent wars the U.S. and its European allies waged in the Middle East, Muslims have also been the target of hate crimes and hostility in the U.S. and in Europe (e.g., European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, 2021; U.S. Department of Justice, 2015). Muslims are among the most dehumanized groups in these contexts (Kteily & Bruneau, 2017), and have been disproportionately targeted by surveillance measures and prosecutions that involve human rights abuses (Human Rights Watch, 2014; Renton, 2018). We assessed inclusive and exclusive victim beliefs with im -
proved measures, including a balanced assessment of qualitative and quantitative comparisons. Additionally, we tested three potential     |  5

in turn, inclusive and exclusive victim beliefs mediate the effects of 
these more general orientations on attitudes towards historical per -
petrator groups and minority groups suffering in the present. To enable comparison and direct replication of the findings 
across contexts, we used the same outcome measures and control variables in all four studies, adapted to the respective context. To conceptually expand the processes we were able to test without overextending the length of the survey, we assessed different gen -

10-1002_ejsp-2756.pdf,Union,"In Studies 2A–  B, we therefore examine comparative victim 
beliefs with a regional (rather than global) reference group in two 
Central Eastern European countries, Hungary and Poland. The com -
parison of the national ingroup's suffering with other groups in this region is relevant in Poland and Hungary because of empires, wars, and political regimes that affected numerous countries in the re -
gion (e.g., the occupation and division of countries, World War I and World War II, displacement and ethnic cleansing during and after the wars, oppression under Communism, including the Hungarian refu -
gee crisis in 1956: Szabó, 2020; Szabó et al., 2020). Hungarian history entails repeated victimization by several 
outgroups (László, 2013). After the defeat against the Ottoman Empire in 1526, Hungary was occupied for centuries by differ -
ent empires and countries. The most significant collective trauma in Hungarian history was the Trianon Treaty after World War I, resulting in Hungary losing a large percentage of its population and land to Romania, Czechoslovakia, the Ukraine, and others (Romsics, 2002). Poland also has a long history of collective vic -
timization that shapes present-  day societal discourse (Bilewicz & 
Stefaniak, 2013), the most central being: the partition of Poland 
between Russia, Prussia, and Austria (1795–  1918), Poland's oc -
cupation during World War II by Nazi Germany and the Soviet 
Union, and the post-  war Communist period including Stalinist re -
pression (CBOS, 2015). Due to this history, aside from Germans, 
Russians are also often perceived as a relevant adversary group 
(Bilewicz et al., 2019). 5.1  | Methods

2009ab) and enhanced contrast sensitivity were also shown to be
affected by video game training (Li, Polat, Makous, & Bavelier, 2009). Itis important to point out that improvements in visual information proc-
essing were observed not only in normal-vision subjects but also in
patients with vision problems. For example, Li, Ngo, Nguyen, & Levi(2011) showed that patients with amblyopia substantially improved in awide range of fundamental vision functions, such as visual acuity and
spatial attention, after a short video game training. Furthermore, in a
study that was both empirical and conceptual, Bejjanki and others(2014) described that video games improved performance on an orien-
tation identification task under varying levels of external noise and pro-
posed a model where improvement in the task was accompanied byreweighting of connectivity between the visual areas of the brain. On the other hand, not all studies on video game experience have
yielded positive results (Boot, Blakely, & Simons, 2011; Gobet et al.,
2014), and a number of authors have discussed the methodologicalshortcomings that are present in the field (Boot et al., 2011; Boot, &Simons, 2012; Kristj /C19ansson, 2013; Bisoglio, Michaels, Mervis, & Ashin-
off, 2014). Some research has shown only little or no improvement incognitive performance (Boot et al., 2011; Irons, Remington, & McLean,2011). However, it should be noted that most of those studies did notcontrol for the genres of video games played by participants, and all
genres were usually put into one category of “action ”video games. This category is usually comprised of first- and third-person shootergenres, but there are studies with “action ”video game player samples
that also include other genres (e.g., Green, & Bavelier, 2003; Castelet al., 2005; Sungur et al., 2012), and studies that concentrated on spe-cific genres (e.g., Tanaka et al., 2013; Dobrowolski et al., 2015; Kimet al., 2015; Dale & Green, 2017ab)."

The present study examined the impact of stereotype

reporting one’s gender before an EFT and having an

of FI among females. Females who were paired with a

than males. In this condition, gender identity was not

10-1002_ijop-12245.pdf,Union,"Most of the former research focuses on self-esteem in
explaining how narcissism is beneficial or costly for sub-jective well-being. Higher self-esteem is supposed to pro-
duce a higher self-reported level of satisfaction with life,
as narcissistic individuals not only perceive themselves
in a positive context but also their happiness (Sedikides
et al., 2004). Moreover, the distinction between healthy
(grandiose) and pathological (vulnerable) narcissism isbased on the difference between the self-esteem level and
stability (Miller & Campbell, 2008; Miller et al., 2011). Grandiose narcissism is associated with stable and exag-
gerated self-esteem, vulnerable narcissism with unstable
and fragile self-esteem (Miller & Campbell, 2008). Forthis reason, only vulnerable narcissism is linked with
negative affectivity (Miller et al., 2011) and inconsistent
findings for the relationship between narcissism andsubjective well-being refer only to its grandiose aspect. However, one of the most often reported costly man-
ifestations of narcissism is psychological entitlement(Raskin & Terry, 1988; Sedikides et al., 2004), which is

supposed to negatively influence subjective well-being
(Twenge & Campbell, 2009). For instance, Twenge andCampbell (2009), in their concept of the American cul-ture of narcissism, argue that it is associated both withunrealistically high self-evaluations and expectations ofothers, which may lead to a lower level of satisfactionwith one’s life. Thus, psychological entitlement could beresponsible for the negative effect of narcissism on sub-jective well-being. Another important aspect within narcissism’s concep-
tualization is its nature, predominantly assumed to beagentic (Sedikides et al., 2004). However, Gebauer et al. (2012) postulated that there is a distinction between agen-tic and communal grandiose narcissism."

communal narcissism (e.g. “I am an amazing listener”). Participants answered questions on a 7-point scale from
1=“strongly disagree” to 7 =“strongly agree”. The scale
has demonstrated reliability and validity (Gebauer et al.,

Finally, given thatour findings originated from European samples andas there has been some consideration of the differingnature of narcissism in collectivistic societies (Twenge
& Campbell, 2009), it would be interesting to determine
the extent to which these models were evident in suchcultures. The findings supplement current knowledge on
grandiose narcissism, in terms of both agentic andcommunal narcissism, showing that psychological enti-tlement is its important epiphenomenon, as outlinedby other scholars (e.g. Freud, 1914; Raskin & Terry,1988). While previous research focused on the role of
self-esteem in the functioning of narcissistic individu-
als, these findings suggest some psychological costs ofnarcissism, such as unrealistic expectations of others. Manuscript received March 2015

people in social relationships (Hermans, 2003). Conse-
quently, not only external (interpersonal) but also internal(intrapersonal) dialogs are possible. An internal dialog
means that a person alternately adopts (at least) two dif-
ferent perspectives and that utterances formulated fromthese viewpoints refer to one another (Puchalska-Wasyl,
2015). A personal viewpoint may (but does not have to)
be a party to an internal dialog: I can imagine my conver-

quarreling friends whom I would like to help. Internal dialogs can be divided according to differ-

into account and integrate all the viewpoints involved;
consequently, they can result in creative solutions. Confrontational inner dialogs, by contrast, emphasize
differences between standpoints and aim to enhance oneof them and ignore or deprecate the others (Borawski,
2011; Młynarczyk, 2011; Nir, 2012). At the specific
level, researchers differ in their understanding of inte-gration and confrontation. In an attempt to reconcile
and elaborate their approaches, I assumed and empir-
ically confirmed (Puchalska-Wasyl, 2016; see further:
Integration–Confrontation [ICON] measure) that inte-
gration and confrontation are independent dimensions indescribing internal dialog. Integration concerns the level
of agreement between the standpoints clashing in dialog,
while confrontation involves the assessment of victoryand defeat in each party to dialog, reflecting the advan-
tage of one of them. Integration comprises two processes:
the extension and alignment of perspectives/viewpoints,whereas confrontation encompasses their valorization
and devalorization."
10-1002_ijop-12266.pdf,Union,"Why psychological distance? Observations of negotiations in the social world sug-
gest that if negotiators concede on secondary issues inexchange for getting what they want on high-priority
issues (a process called logrolling), their behavior is more
integrative and maximizes both individual and joint out-
comes. A study of live negotiation (Henderson, Trope,
& Carnevale, 2006) conducted in line with the construallevel theory of psychological distance (CLT; Bar-Anan,
Liberman, & Trope, 2006; Trope & Liberman, 2010)
shows that 91% of dyads reached a fully logrolling agree-ment when interlocutors adopted a perspective temporally
distant from the realization of the negotiated settlement
(the negotiated event was to take place five months later).Of dyads with a temporally near perspective (with the
negotiated event on the following day), only 50% reached
a fully logrolling agreement. It was concluded that a tem-
porally distant perspective promotes integrative behav-
ior during the negotiation and, consequently, producesgreater joint outcomes. According to CLT, temporal perspective is one of the
psychological distance dimensions, aside from spatial andsocial ones and hypotheticality (Bar-Anan et al., 2006;
Trope & Liberman, 2010). Psychological distance is a

subjective experience that something is close or far away
from “the self, here, and now.” When I adopt the view-point of the other (e.g., partner or stranger), I move onthe social dimension, and the further from the self theother is, the larger the distance. The further that which Ithink about is from “now” (future or past) or from “here”(a distant place), the larger the temporal or spatial dis-tance, respectively. “Real” and “unlikely to occur” consti-tute the extremes of the hypotheticality dimension. Thosefour distance dimensions are mentally associated, whichmeans the experience of distance on one dimension auto-matically affects the perceived distance on other dimen-sions. Additionally, those distance dimensions influenceand are influenced by the level of mental construal. Themore distant an object/action/event is from “the self, here,and now,” the higher (more abstract) its level of con-strual, and vice versa."

tance, whereas the dependent variables were the indices
of integration and confrontation in the dialogs conducted

Measure
Dependent variables were measured using the ICON
method, designed by Puchalska-Wasyl (2016) and avail-able upon request. It is a 13-item measure of the intensity
of integrative and confrontational characteristics of inter-
nal dialog, completed with a specific imaginary dialog
in mind. ICON is based on the author’s understanding
of integration and confrontation as independent dimen-
sions of internal dialog (see Introduction). Integration
refers to the degree of agreement achieved between
clashing standpoints, while confrontation—connected
with the intensity of victory and defeat perceived in each
party—reflects the advantage of one of them. © 2016 International Union of Psychological Science4 PUCHALSKA-WASYL
Integration encompasses the processes of extension
and alignment of the standpoints involved in a dialog,whereas confrontation is constituted by the processesof their valorization and devalorization. Each processpotentially occurs in each party to dialog. Thus, the firsteight ICON items, rated on a 0–6 scale, concern thefollowing, respectively:
1. first perspective extension (EXT1)
2. second perspective extension (EXT2)
3. first perspective alignment (ALI1)4. second perspective alignment (ALI2)5. first perspective valorization (V1)6. second perspective valorization (V2)7. first perspective devalorization (DV1)8. second perspective devalorization (DV2)
The remaining, supplementary items (0–6 scale) con-
cern, e.g., the participant’s identification with the first andthe second perspective. The higher the intensity of extension and alignment
processes in each party, the stronger is the integration. Itsintensity, from 0 to 24, is computed as follows:
INT=EXT1+EXT2+ALI1+ALI2
Confrontation consists in the polarization of
partners—maximizing the valorization and minimiz-ing the devalorization of one party while minimizing thevalorization and maximizing the devalorization of theother. It increases with the growth of disproportion inperceiving the discussing parties."
10-1002_ijop-12266.pdf,Union,"Procedure
The study was conducted in Poland. It took 20–30 min-
utes. Participants were informed that the study was anony-
mous and voluntary and that it concerned the ability to
adopt various people’s viewpoints and to empathize with
their emotions. The procedure was based on mental sim-ulation of an interpersonal situation, different versions
of which are used in various research areas (e.g., Slot-
ter et al., 2012). The participants received a description
of a fictional problem situation faced by a young mar-
ried couple. The woman—a wife and a mother—wanted
© 2016 International Union of Psychological ScienceDISTANCE AND INTEGRATIVE INTERNAL DIALOG 5
to change her job from well-paid but inconsistent with
her aspirations to uncertain but ambition-fulfilling. The
husband opposed this change as threatening the family’s
financial situation. After reading the description, partic-ipants were to write down an imaginary dialog between
that couple. The dialog was to end in a decision about
what to do next. The instruction was identical in bothexperimental groups, but the situation description wasslightly different. In the proximal perspective group, the
fictitious spouses lived at the same time in the same
town in which the research took place; they were roughlythe same age as the participants (soon after graduation)
and had fairly popular Polish names."
10-1002_ijop-12266.pdf,Union,"The distribution of the number of integrative and
confrontational dialogs in both experimental groupswas determined and analyses were performed usingchi-squared test. Generally, a significant relationship wasfound between psychological distance and internal dialogtype (χ

perspective group there were significantly more con-frontational dialogs than integrative ones. However, thedifference disappeared in the distant perspective group(Table 1 and Figure 1), which was caused by a significant
increase in the number of integrative dialogs in this
condition ( χ

10-1002_ijop-12266.pdf,Union,"Research shows that the more other peopleresemble us, the more we like them (Sprecher, 2014). It
is also known that the success of a person we like gives
us joy and his/her defeat causes sorrow (Pietraszkiewicz
& Wojciszke, 2014). This may have led to the viewpoint
of a liked character being easily strengthened in a dialogand, consequently, to the polarization of the interlocutors,
manifesting itself in a high confrontation index. Adopt-
ing a distant perspective results in a weaker focus on cons
and pragmatic concerns (Eyal et al., 2004; Kivetz & Tyler,
2007). The fact that the importance of the drawbacks ofthe discussed change diminished may have resulted in
similar levels of the participant’s identification with both
characters. As previously, analyses of additional ICON
items showed that in the distant perspective group there
© 2016 International Union of Psychological ScienceDISTANCE AND INTEGRATIVE INTERNAL DIALOG 7
were no differences in the degree of identification with
the wife and the husband. In such a situation, polariza-
tion is undesirable, since the defeat of any of the parties
to dialog causes sorrow (Pietraszkiewicz & Wojciszke,2014). This could explain the decrease in the intensity of
the confrontation process in the group with increased dis-
tance. However, the confirmation of these interpretativehypotheses requires further research, including replica-
tions of the described identification patterns in analyses
taking distance and gender into account simultaneously. Can the decrease in confrontation in the distant per-
spective group be explained by the participants’ assump-tion that if the situation was about spouses and a problem
they had in the past, then their marriage must have sur-
vived the trial thanks to a creative (integrating) resolutionof the problem? Such an explanation would be possible if
the participants had not been informed that the situation
was invented."
10-1002_ijop-12266.pdf,Union,"Still, in further research
each dimension should also be manipulated separately
to check whether indeed each has identical influenceon the integrative and confrontational characteristics
of internal dialogs. Moreover, the procedure presented
here came down to the participants imagining how twostrangers would talk to each other. The next study should
be planned to follow the self/not-self ×proximal/distant
perspective design. CLT assumes that imagining oneselfin dialog will reduce distance towards the situation
enacted (on the social dimension). In the light of the
results presented here, what should be expected in that
condition compared with the not-self condition (i.e.,
adopting another person’s viewpoint) is a higher intensityof confrontation in the proximal perspective group and,
consequently, a lower number of integrative dialogs in
the distant perspective group. The next important stepwill be to test the above-mentioned relationships in inter-
nal dialogs concerning a problematic issue of personal

importance to participants. Such internal dialogs can
become “prototypes” of interpersonal relations (cf. Honeycutt, 2003; Puchalska-Wasyl, 2006). If it was found
that a real conversation concerning a difficult matter (e.g.,a serious conflict) becomes significantly less confronta-
tional after it has been imagined in different space and
time, these results could have enormous practical sig-nificance. Internal dialog, which is now a useful tool in
psychotherapy (Hermans & Dimaggio, 2004), could not
only strengthen its position in psychological practice but
also become a simple and inexpensive instrument for
shaping more positive social behaviors in everyday life. Manuscript received October 2015

10-1002_ijop-12372.pdf,Union,"However, such a tempting conclusion, particularly for
developmental psychologists, needs to be treated with
caution, as we have to keep in mind that this study was
entirely based on self-report of both own misbehaviour
and parenting practices. Our hypothesis concerning the direct and indirect
effects of parenting practices on the approval of extreme
aggressive acts, and illegitimate justifications of aggres-
sion, was only partially confirmed. Specifically, in the
case of the approval of extreme aggressive acts andillegitimate justifications of aggression, we found only an
indirect effect of CP mediated by delinquent behaviour
in adolescence. As the extreme aggressive acts imply
killing, torturing or hitting, and illegitimate justifications
of aggression set practically no limits for the manifesta-
tion of aggressive behaviour, their high levels of approval
must be associated with exposure to aggression at an early
stage of development. Even then, it is still not sufficient to
approve of extreme aggressive acts and illegitimate justi-
fications, if it is not reinforced by delinquent behaviour
at the adolescent stage. This finding fits in well with the
results of a longitudinal study (Guerra et al., 2003) on
normative beliefs about aggression, which showed

the approval of minor aggressive acts resulted from
the direct effect of PA used by parents to correct childmisbehaviour. Psychological aggression is in this study a multiple

However, previous research clearlyshowed that the bias of retrospective reports is not suf-ficiently great to invalidate reports of childhood adversi-ties (Hard & Rutter, 2004) and the general tendency tounderestimate the adverse experience from childhood hasbeen discovered rather than overrate it (Brown, Craig,Harris, Handley, & Harvey, 2007). In future studies, wewould recommend to construct the indicators of mothers’and fathers’ parenting practices on the basis of self-reportfrom two sources rather than one, that is, from adultchildren and simultaneously from parents themselves toincrease the accuracy of retrospective assessment and todecrease the risk of shared variance bias. Moreover, dueto the fact that the sample consisted exclusively of stu-dents, including students of very specific faculty, that is,fire engineering, our results should be generalised withcaution. Both, students of education and fire engineeringare focused on supporting others, though the latter addi-tionally represent military service which might boost theirapproval of aggression regardless of parenting practicesexperienced in childhood.

defining temperament, mainly stemming from the Pavlo-

in behaviour but also the stylistic and energetic aspects
of behaviour regulation as opposed to content-relatedaspects of behaviour found in personality dimensions
(Kandler, Riemann, & Angleitner, 2013). These stylistic
and energetic aspects of behaviour may be significantlyassociated with subjective well-being, but their specific

In the present study we analysed the relationships
between subjective well-being as conceptualised by(Diener, 2000; Positive Affect, Negative Affect and
Satisfaction with Life) and six temperamental traits
proposed in RTT (Strelau & Zawadzki, 1995; Briskness,Perseveration, Sensory Sensitivity, Emotional Reactivity,
Activity and Endurance). Can temperament predict subjective
well-being? As expected, subjective well-being components (higher
Life Satisfaction and Positive Affect and lowerNegative Affect) were correlated with five temperament
traits: higher Briskness, Endurance and Activity and
lower Perseveration and Emotional Reactivity. These
results of “zero-order” correlations are fully consistentwith what we know about relationships between tem-perament, personality and subjective well-being. Ourresults are also concordant with earlier findings aboutcorrelations between particular temperament dimensions
and specific negative aspects of well-being (Cieslak
et al., 2008; Fruehstorfer et al., 2012; Rzeszutek &Schier, 2014; Zawadzki & Popiel, 2012)."

10-1002_ijop-12414.pdf,Union,"Their emotional interpretations of ambiguousstimuli are also more positive and they tend to reactwith less negative emotions as compared to highlyemotionally reactive individuals (Zalewska, 2003,2011). High Emotional Reactivity is linked to poorerwell-being (in all three components), possibly througha decreased effectiveness in functioning under stress,
leading to less effective and less successful outcomes
of individual activities (Strelau, 2008). Functions ofEmotional Reactivity include performance in stress, sothrough a decreased performance, more reactive peoplemay experience not only more negative emotions, butalso less positive emotions, evaluate their lives as lesssatisfying in comparison to less reactive people, whoperformbetterinawiderarrayofcircumstances(Strelau,2008). Secondly, higher Perseveration was linked to stronger
positive and negative affect, but these effects were notfound among younger adolescents. This suggest, thatfrom late adolescence the core function of Perseveration(tendency to continue and to repeat behaviour after the
stimulus ceased, Strelau & Zawadzki, 1995) refers not
only to behaviour but also to accompanying emotions.TheroleofPerseverationisthereforenotstraightforward,

it is connected to more intense negative and positive
emotions, in other words: a more diverse emotional
experience. This suggests that high Perseveration among
adults and older adolescents can also serve a beneficialfunction—it may promote the experience of positive
emotions,whentheinfluenceofothertemperamenttraits
has been controlled for. In these groups, Perseverationmay be necessary for prolonged experience of positive
emotions (Positive Affect)—without it Positive Affect
is vanishing very quickly. On the other hand, it may also
prolong the experience of negative emotions, serving a
rather unbeneficial function. Thirdly, higher levels of Activitywere connected to
higher Positive Affect and Satisfaction. This means that
positiveindicesofsubjectivewell-being,higherLifeSat-isfaction and Positive Affect are possibly facilitated by
Activity,butthistraitmaynotlimittheexperienceofneg-
ative emotions."
10-1002_ijop-12414.pdf,Union,"This pattern was expressed in full only among older
adolescents. Among younger adolescents, the role of
Activity and Perseveration were not significant, onlyEmotionalReactivityandEnduranceremained,andthese
are the two traits that together determine stimulation
processing capacities. Among adults Positive Affectwas predicted by higher Perseveration, lower Emotional
Reactivity and higher Activity—the two last traits most
strongly express the harmony between the amount ofstimulationsuppliedandtheabilitytoprocessitandthey
are most strongly linked to Neuroticism and Extraver-
sion (Costa & McCrae, 1980; Zawadzki & Strelau,1997). Naturally, these effects can be cohort-related since
this is a cross-section study. If, however, they are relatedto developmental changes, then the study suggests
© 2017 TheAuthors. InternationalJournalofPsychology published byJohnWiley &Sons Ltdonbehalf of International Union of Psychological Science.8 BOJANOWSKA AND ZALEWSKA
that the period of development moderates the links
between temperament and well-being. Among younger
adolescents, high Positive Affect was predicted only
by traits responsible for high stimulation process-
ing capacity (high Endurance and low Emotional
Reactivity), possibly because their activity is more
externally controlled. Among older adolescents, it was
predicted by traits responsible for effective stimulation
regulation—connected with stimulation processing
capacities (Emotional Reactivity and Endurance), stim-
ulation supply (Activity) and additionally by high
Perseveration, which may help prolong the experience
of positive emotions. Among adults, the role of traits
expressing stimulation processing capacity seems to
become relatively less important in predicting the Pos-
itive Affect, as Endurance is no longer its significant
predictor. All this suggest that temperamental regulatory
functions may be expressed differently, depending on
the period of development—at least for the Positive
Affect. Temperamental predictors of Negative Affect
In general, higher Negative Affect was predicted by
lower Briskness, higher Perseveration and higher Emo-
tional Reactivity; however, among younger adolescents
Perseveration was not a significant predictor."

temperament traits and SWB components are more
complex than could be expected from previous research
on temperament–SWB and personality–SWB relations. Previous temperament–SWB investigations focusedmainly on negative aspects of well-being, neglecting itspossible roles for the positive aspects of human expe-
rience. Personality–SWB research, on the other hand,
focused mostly on the role of Neuroticism and Extraver-sion (Costa & McCrae, 1980; DeNeve & Cooper, 1998),
which suggested how Emotional Reactivity and Activity
may impact SWB, but did not offer such explanationsfor Perseveration, Endurance or Briskness. In our study,we showed that a clear correspondence to effects of

positioned than women in societal hierarchies—there is no single country in the world without a gender gap. In
contrast, researchers have found that the women-are-wonderful effect—that women are evaluated more positively thanmen overall—is also common. Cross-cultural studies on gender equality reveal that the more gender egalitarian the society
is, the less prevalent explicit gender stereotypes are. Yet, because self-reported gender stereotypes may differ from implicit
attitudes towards each gender, we reanalysed data collected across 44 cultures, and (a) confirmed that societal genderegalitarianism reduces the women-are-wonderful effect when it is measured more implicitly (i.e."

do stereotypes of women, though further studies areneeded to more comprehensively identify the underlying
mechanisms. Although the large number of cultures sampled
strengthens the presented conclusions, our study has
some shortcomings. For instance, the lack of negative
facial expressions (e.g. sad, angry or scared faces) in

the stimuli we used is one weakness. Another limitation
of the presented research lies in the lack of context
when making judgments; contextual information may
differentially influence perceptions of men relative to
women (Eagly & Karau, 2002). Also, perceiver ethnicity
should be analysed in future studies as ingroup and out-
group effects may play a role in these social perception
processes. Next, following Krys et al. (2016) we usedthe termculture , although the group-level distinctions
could have alternatively been labelled national culture
or justnation (excluding South Africa and India as they
were explicitly split into cultural sub-samples). We are
aware thatculture is a far more complex construct than
nation ; future studies need to be more precise in differ-
entiating these two."

on asking participants about intention prior to behaviour,

explain observed relations between verbal attitudes andpertinent behaviours towards the Jewish minority. Our
research is the first direct test of these mechanisms in
the context of intergroup relations. The potential bias

Cognitive dissonance and the

erence to people’s need for consistency. Disequilibriumbetweencognitivecomponents(knowledge,opinion,andattitude) and behaviours evokes an unpleasant tension inindividualsreferredtoascognitivedissonance(Festinger,1962).Motivationtoavoidcognitivedissonanceactivatesvarious responses in people, one of which is engaging inbehavioursconsistentwithacognitivecomponent.Verbalstatements of attitudes in questionnaires may activate apersonalorsocialnormofbeingconsistentindeclarationsandactions.Orresponsesmayserveascuetorecallsitu-
ations in which an actor violated this norm and behaved
inconsistently (Wood et al., 2015). Indirect evidence that cognitive dissonance accounts
for the question-behaviour effect stems from researchby Spangenberg, Sprott, Grohmann, and Smith (2003)in which the effect was minimised by means of awell-established method of decreasing cognitive dis-sonance. That is, the enhancement of participants’self-affirmation decreased artificial inflation in theperformance of a subsequent behaviour. Another argument is that a sequence of partic-
ipants fulfilling a smaller request (completing a
questionnaire-based attitude measure) and a largerone (engaging in a relevant behaviour) coincides witha standard procedure of evoking compliance in thefoot-in-the-door technique. And the dominant mecha-nism underlying the effectiveness of the foot-in-the-dooriscognitive dissonance."

towards Jews. Future research on attitudes towards other
minority groups should confirm the generality of ourfindings. The implications of our studies are twofold. First, our
results show that researchers should be more cautiouswhen formulating claims about the external validity ofverbal measures of attitudes towards minorities. Espe-
cially in Internet studies in which the time interval
between measures is short and a predicted variable isoften hypothetical, the effect of the order of administra-tion of the measures should be controlled. Doubts aboutthe universal validity of some instruments measuringattitudes towards minorities should lead us to considerdeveloping field experiments and measures independentof self-reports (Baumeister, Vohs, & Funder, 2007).Second, our findings and results in the health domain(Conner et al., 2011) suggest that activating positiveattitudes could potentially serve as a practical means
of triggering socially acceptable behaviours towards
minorities.InPoland,interactionswithJewsandthustheexperience with the attitude object is limited, becausethe Jewish minority constitutes merely 0.002% of thecountry’s population (Central Statistical Office, 2011).In consequence, in Poland attitudes towards Jews areconsidered symbolic in its nature (Bilewicz etal., 2013).This symbolic nature might thus explain why attitudesneed to be made salient and accessible directly before arelevant behaviour to be effective for this behaviour asin the reported studies by Bilewicz et al."

People who share this conviction believe thatsuccess is possible only at the expense of other people’sfailures. Former studies conducted on several samples showed
that BZSG affects not only cognition and emotions (e.g.,negative vision of the social world, delegitimization ofsocialsystems,antagonisticperceptionofinterests,inter-personal distrust between people, pessimism, anxiety,and a tendency to rumination, entitlement attitudes);but also behavioural tendencies (e.g., interpersonal con-flicts, cooperation avoidance, withdrawing from socialexchange) (Ró ̇zycka & Wojciszke, 2010). Furthermore,
it was found that BZSG is related with: a negative butnot positive reciprocity norm, an external locus of con-
trol, belief in the injustice of the social world, belief in
a dangerous world, belief in the world as a jungle andnationalauthoritarianism,alsofeelingoneselftobealoserin social exchange (Ró ̇zycka, 2012). The most recent studies showed that the BZSG cor-
relates positively with all facets that define neuroticism:the level of free-floating anxiety; the tendency to expe-rience anger and related states such as frustration andbitterness; the tendency to experience feelings of guilt,sadness,despondency,loneliness,andsocialanxiety;and
general susceptibility to stress."

Previous research on the BZSG scale showed that the
pattern of correlations between BZSG scores and a

countries ( N=6138), thus providing some evidence
for the cross-cultural validity of the given construct(Ró̇zycka-Tran et al., 2015). In this paper, we show that
theBZSGscaledisplaysconfiguralandmetricinvariance
across an additional wide range of countries ( N=9907),
which is sufficient to allow comparison of correlates andpredictors of BZSG scale scores in different countries,alsomade inmultilevel analyses. This cross-cultural study has also confirmed that the
eight-item BZSG scale has a one-factor structure in 36countries,consideringarelativelylargenumberofgroupsandvariedsamplesizeswithineachgroup(seeRutkowski& Svetina, 2014). According to CFA results of separateanalyses for each country, the CFI and SRMR supported
the fit of the one-factor model of the BZSG. The results

eties had a tendency to view their world in zero-sum
terms: “peasants view their social, economic, and natu-raluniverses—theirtotalenvironment—asoneinwhich
all of the desired things in life such as land, wealth,
health, friendship and love, manliness and honor, respectandstatus,powerandinfluence,securityandsafety, exist
in finite quantity andare always in short supply ”( F o s -
ter, 1965, p. 296). As BZSG seems to have serious andnegative consequences (like lower well-being, or higher
levels of prejudice), it is important to know which cul-
turalfactorscouldberesponsibleforthedisseminationof
such a belief in a population. Also, it would be interest-
ingtoidentifyhowculturalfactorsinfluencetherelation-shipbetweenBZSGandoutcomevariables.Forinstance,
it is possible that antagonistic beliefs are more adaptive
in scarce resources conditions, so that its negative rela-tion to subjective well-being is weaker in less affluent
countries in comparison to more affluent ones. Because
zero-sum beliefs are associated with greater outgroupbias and in-group favouritism (Wilkins, Wellman, Bab-
bitt, Toosie, & Schad, 2015) or group membership bias
(Smithson, Sopeña, & Platow, 2015), society would ben-
efit from identifying strategies that contribute to a more
cooperative approach to intergroup relations in whichzero-sum beliefs, and their negative consequences, are
minimised. The BZSG scale appears to be useful for measuring

a lack of accurate knowledge about them may, therefore,interfere withadaptation to a culture; for example, a lack

data obtained using the NPI. THE CONCEPT AND MEASUREMENT OF
NARCISSISM
The concept of narcissism is one of the most popular
constructs in personality and social psychology (Miller& Campbell, 2008). It is typically defined as a grandiose
self-view, a need for power and feelings of entitlement
(see Miller & Campbell, 2008 for a review). Undoubt-
edly, the most popular scale for measuring narcissism
is the Narcissistic Personality Inventory (NPI; Raskin
© 2018 International Union of Psychological Science2̇ZEMOJTEL-PIOTROWSKA ET AL. & Terry, 1988). The original scale is comprised of 40
items. A three-factor solution for the NPI-40 was orig-inally proposed (Ackerman etal., 2011) comprisingleadership/authority (LA), grandiose exhibitionism (GE)and entitlement/exploitativeness (EE). Both, LA andGE are related to socially potential positive outcomessuch as extraversion, goal-persistence, and self-esteem,while EE is related to socially toxic negative outcomessuch as low empathy, low self-esteem, aggressiveness,neuroticism, disagreeableness, Machiavellianism andantisocial tendencies (Ackerman et al., 2011; Gentileet al.,2013). Two abbreviated versions of the NPI-40 were pro-
posed: the NPI-16 (Ames, Rose, & Anderson, 2006) andthe NPI-13 (Gentile et al., 2013)."
10-1002_ijop-12487.pdf,Union,"Thus, testing the measurement invariance of the
NPIacrossculturesshouldincludepopulationsfromout-
side of English-speaking countries. For this reason, we
examine the measurement invariance of the NPI in three
different countries: Japan, Poland, and the UK, and its
applicability incross-cultural studies. We chose these countries because Poland is a
Central-European country with a different cultural
background to that of the UK and Japan is unique in
terms of its values, religion and language (Hofstede,
Hofstede, & Minkov, 2010). All these countries differ
in their individualism levels, where the UK is an indi-
vidualistic country, Japan collectivistic and Poland is
placed in the middle of the individualism–collectivism
dimension(Hofstedeet al.,2010).Lowerlevelsofnarcis-
sism have been reported among collectivistic or Eastern
samples than among individualistic or Western sam-
ples, Fukunishi et al. (1996) reported that the Japanese
indicated a lower level of narcissism in comparison to
Americans and Chinese. Despite China and Japan have
treated as both collectivistic countries, they significantly
© 2018 International Union of Psychological ScienceCROSS-CULTURAL GENERALISABITY OF THE NPI 3
differ in their orientations toward interdependence. For
instance, Japanese conception of happiness (Hitokoto &
Uchida, 2015), involves being ordinary, that is, orientedtoward being similar to in-group others and building
personal satisfaction in harmony with others. Being
narcissistic in such a context undermines rejection
by others, therefore collectivism in Japan is marked
by its strong rejection avoidance, which can be mea-
sured by self-report scale (Hashimoto & Yamagishi,
2013; Noguchi, 2007). In contrast, the Chinese self
involves duality of self-enhancement that manifest in
implicit self-effacement in their in-group and explicit
self-enhancement (Yamaguchi et al., 2007). To elucidate
the largest cultural variation relevant for the current
self-enhancement study using self-report, we considered
best to include Japan as one representative of collec-
tivistic cultures. Thus, we expect that Japan will score
lowest on narcissism as in comparison to Poland and
the UK."

Despite the NPI is one of the most widely used instru-
ments measuring narcissism (Raskin & Terry, 1988), nostudies reported scalar invariance for cross-cultural com-parisons. Given the repeated problems with establishedmeasurement invariance for NPI (Cozma et al., 2014;
Meisel et al., 2016), two solutions for these problems
were proposed: (a) examination of the cultural universal-ity versus specificity of three dimensions of narcissism;(b) examine measurement invariance by using a tetra-choric correlation matrix, appropriate to the binary char-acterofdata.WechoseNPI-13forexamining thenarcis-sismconceptasthisscalereflectsthreebasiccomponentsofnarcissism:LA, GE and EE. Based on results of measurement invariance analysis
oftheNPI-13,wecouldclaimthat,inallthreecountries,
the three-factor concept of narcissism (Ackerman et al.,
2011) is similar; however, the lack of scalar invariancesuggests that it is impossible to compare predictors ofthree-factor narcissism and its latent mean scores acrosscultures. Weidentifiedthatonlydistributionofanswersonitems

results of cross-country comparisons in the levels of nar-
cissism were congruent with former studies (Fukunishi
et al., 1996). We have found that although the Japanese

10-1002_ijop-12514.pdf,Union,"The viewpointsadopted in ID can represent personal perspectives and/or
someone else’s perspectives. The former is represented
in the old fisherman’s ID, wherein we see two of San-
tiago’s personal perspectives: Santiago-dreamer versus
Santiago-realist. The latter is characteristic of IDs reflect-
ing social interactions. For example, when preparing
for an important conversation with your boss or friend,
you rehearse the arguments you intend to use. In these
rehearsals, you sometimes imagine your interlocutor’s
responses, which in turn, elicit further arguments and
responses from you. In such IDs, one viewpoint/party isyours (your personal perspective, further referred to as

the viewpoint of the dialogue’s author), whereas the other
viewpoint/party represents an (imagined) interlocutor. The current study is focused on IDs simulating social
interactions. IDs may be characterised according to different criteria
(Ole´s & Puchalska-Wasyl, 2012). Recently, researchers
have been interested in the distinction between inte-grative and confrontational dialogues (Borawski, 2011;
Młynarczyk, 2011; Nir, 2012; Puchalska-Wasyl, 2016a,
2016b). Assuming that each ID is characterised by two
simultaneous processes of integration and confrontation,
an integrative ID has a higher intensity of integrationthan confrontation, whereas a confrontational ID has the
reverse pattern (Puchalska-Wasyl, 2016a, 2016b). In light of the two-dimensional model of ID which will
be adopted in the present paper, integration and confronta-
tion are two independent dimensions of the description
of IDs (for comparison to the one-dimensional model seePuchalska-Wasyl, 2016a)."
10-1002_ijop-12514.pdf,Union,"Some studies show a connectionbetween treating others as similar to oneself and perceiv-ing them as attractive, as well as liking them (Fawcett& Markson, 2010; Sprecher, 2014). It is also knownthat we are more willing to help those who resembleus and those we like (Karylowski, 1976). Similaritymay also lead to cooperation and positive evaluations
of one another (Ashforth & Mael, 1989). Moreover,
it has been found that dyads with similar-and-high aswell as similar-and-low levels of both agreeableness andextraversion communicate in a more positive emotionalmanner while negotiating, which in turn reduces timespent negotiating and relationship conflict, and improvesperceptions of one’s negotiating partner (Wilson, DeRue,Matta, Howe, & Conlon, 2016). Most of these behaviourscould be called integrative ones. © 2018 International Union of Psychological ScienceSIMILARITY AND INTEGRATION IN INTERNAL DIALOGUE 3
Second, IDs simulating social relations can be seen in a
broader context of mental imagery—a phenomenon that
is of great importance to social functioning. For instance,it is stressed that mental imagery is a key to understanding
others by simulating their mental states—intentions, feel-
ings and beliefs (“Theory of Mind”; Goldman & Sripada,
2005). It also serves a fundamental function in the selec-
tion, rehearsal, preparation and planning of goal-directed
behaviour (Marks, 1999). It helps us regulate our emo-
tional reactions to past and possible future events, and it
is a key component needed to effect behaviour change
(Crisp & Turner, 2012). Moreover, many studies have
shown that mentally simulating a positive interaction with
an outgroup member can elicit more favourable explicit
and implicit outgroup attitudes, and enhance intentions
to engage in future contact (for review see Crisp &
Turner, 2012). It has been also found that simulation
enhance intentions to a greater extent than did thinking
about reasons for a range of beneficial activities (e.g.,
studying, dieting and exercising) (Ten Eyck, Labansat,
Gresky, Dansereau, & Lord, 2006)."

cation may lead to cooperation and positive evaluations

In light of the two-dimensional model of ID
(Puchalska-Wasyl, 2016a, 2016b, 2017b) which is
adopted in this paper, general integration depends onintegrative attitudes of both parties. Therefore, two addi-
tional hypotheses, which are in fact supplementary to the
H2, were posed:
H2a. Identifying with the interlocutor exerts an indirect
effect on general integration, through the author’s integra-tive attitude. © 2018 International Union of Psychological Science4 PUCHALSKA-WASYL
H2b. Wishfulness of an ID exerts an indirect effect on
general integration, through the interlocutor’s integrative
attitude. H2a is consistent with social identity theory, because
identification with an internal interlocutor may lead
the ID’s author having a better understanding of the
partner’s needs, and thus, modification of his/her own
stance (author’s integrative attitude). H2b is consistentwith similarity–attraction theory, because overly positive
(wishful) thinking about the imagined interlocutor allows
us to see him/her as more understanding and compliant(interlocutor’s integrative attitude). METHOD

was positive ( a1b1=0.192) and statistically significant,
as determined by a bootstrap CI that did not contain
zero (CI: 0.043, 0.475). This was the effect through one
mediator—ID wishfulness (WISH); and this effect wasestablished previously when testing model A. In the com-
petitive model, the direct effect of similarity of ID parties
on general integration was statistically non-significant(c
’=−0.007, p=.973, CI:−0.418, 0.404). This allows us
to conclude that, if similarity between ID parties triggers
a wishful ID, then an increase in general integration inthe ID results from the interlocutor’s (not the author’s)
integrative attitude. DISCUSSION

(2014) showed that people who received bogus infor-
mation (prior to an interaction) that the other party was
similar to them, expected to experience more likingtowards the other and more enjoyment from the interac-
tion. Another uncertainty is what people were focused
on when they assessed their ID as (almost) implausible.Indeed, if they treated their ID’s course as implausible,
they could become discouraged from modelling their real
dialogues on imagined integrative IDs. If, however, theyassessed the integrative solution as implausible, the effect
of discouragement could be weaker, because in this situa-
tion, “implausible” could mean “difficult to achieve but
desirable and worth the effort”. In this context, further
research should differentiate between plausibility of anID’s course and an ID’s result. There are also other limitations of this study that
ought to be considered when interpreting the findings. Todate, most studies based on similarity–attraction theory
have investigated the effects of similarity in terms of
© 2018 International Union of Psychological Science8 PUCHALSKA-WASYL
directly stated attitudes on several issues (e.g., smoking,
drinking, marriage; Byrne, 1962). With reference topersonality similarities, Byrne (1971) highlights thatpersonality characteristics linked to behaviour in aninterpersonal situation are crucial when studying the
similarity–attraction relationship. Several studies have
found support for Byrne’s (1971) contention. Wilsonet al. (2016) found that being similarly high or similarlylow on agreeableness or extraversion positively impactedoutcomes of negotiations, but this effect did not gen-eralise to the personality dimensions of the Big Five,outside of the “interpersonal plane.” In my study, theparticipants listed any three characteristics that were toshow the similarity between them and their interlocutors.It is possible that this aspect of the procedure could have
modified the studied relationship in an uncontrolled way. In further research it would be advisable to control thetypes of perceived similarity."

to these definitions nationalism is a specific form of posi-
tive regard for one’s nation, that is, systematically associ-
ated with out-group negativity (Kosterman & Feshbach,
1989). Many studies showed the importance of nationalism
as a determinant of prejudice (Skitka, 2005); however, it
only leads to negative attitudes towards out-groups when
the out-group is perceived as a threat towards the in-groupor potential rival in competition for limited resources
(Bar-Tal, 1993). Out-group attitudes: Classical and modern

Prejudice can be defined in terms of the radial network
model of attitudes, as a negative affective response
which includes both cognitive evaluations and emotional
reactions."
10-1002_ijop-12538.pdf,Union,"BZSG has recently been proposed as a general belief
about social relationships in terms of incompatible inter-
ests (as a zero-sum game; Ró ̇zycka-Tran et al., 2015). More concretely, such a belief provides a worldview of
individual and in/out-group social relationships, that is,based on the assumption that the amount of goods in
the world is finite and hence that one person (or nation)
winning means that others are losing; that the fight over
limited resources is similar at individual and group or
national level. In other words, such a belief influences
how individuals and nations perceive their relationship
in situations where the interests are interdependent in the
context of limited resources. The theoretical background
comes mainly from classic game theory, negotiation the-
ory (e.g., the “fixed-pie bias”), or theories concerning the
role of stress for resources (see Ró ̇zycka-Tran et al., 2015
for review). Although immigrants are often essential to the func-
tioning of first-world economies (e.g., Louis et al., 2013)
in a zero-sum context they can be perceived as a com-
petitive rivals. Many studies have shown that if citizens
believe they are locked into a zero-sum game (i.e., they

belief that as immigrants gain resources and status their
share of both is correspondingly reduced), anti-refugee
and anti-immigration views emerge (Esses et al.,
2001). An entitlement belief is a belief about how a resource
should be distributed, that is, the amount that parties
deserve to receive from its allocation; the belief that
one has the exclusive right to, or sole proprietorship ofa resource; that one is entitled to the “lion’s share” of
a resource, or simply entitled to more resources than
others. Entitlement itself has been defined elsewhere as
a psychological trait reflecting “a stable and pervasive
sense that one deserves more and is entitled to more than
others” (Campbell et al., 2004), which acts as a reference
point that imbues a resource allocation with meaning,and in some cases generates zero-sum thinking (Burleigh,
2016). Entitlement is assumed to be a component of col-
lective narcissism, which is strongly associated with
patriotism and nationalism (Golec de Zavala, Cichocka,Eidelson, & Jayawickreme, 2009). One aspect of collec-
tive narcissism is the expectancy that one’s own group
will or should receive special treatment, that is, a sense of
entitlement. Psychological entitlement, as strictly related
to grandiose narcissism, results in negative attitudes
towards others and positive towards the self (Anastasio &
Rose, 2014; Campbell et al., 2004)."
10-1002_ijop-12538.pdf,Union,"Throughthe level of willingness we understand readiness to
share the national benefits (e.g., citizenship rights)
with out-group populations. We analysed how attitudes
towards out-groups (classical and modern prejudice)
and towards own nation (patriotism, nationalism) con-tributed to attitudes towards refugees. We based our
predictions on social identity theory (Tajfel & Turner,
1979) and self-categorization theory (Turner, Hogg,Oakes, Reicher, & Wetherell, 1987), which posit that
both competition and social identity underlie attitudes
towards immigrants. Based on earlier research (e.g., McAllister, 2016) we
predicted that patriotism would be positively related to
the acceptance of refugees, whilst nationalism would be
related negatively. We also expected these national atti-
tudes to affect attitude towards out-groups via effectson both forms of prejudice. We expected that patriotism
would be negatively associated with both zero-sum think-

zero-sum thinking will be a mediator in the relationship
between national attitudes and prejudice following will-ingness to host refugees in own country. METHOD
Sample and procedure
The participants were 1092 Poles: 517 men (47.3%)
and 575 women ranging in age from 18 to 79 years(M=43.42,SD=15.09). The highest level of education
attained by participants was as follows: 10.6% had com-pleted elementary education, 49.4% had completed sec-ondary education and 40.1% had a university degree."

items of which are reverse-coded. We adopted the contentof items in that way that all items referred to refugees. Only the total score for modern prejudice was used in
this study. We omitted three items (1, 9 and 15) from the
modern prejudice subscales as they had a negative impact

10-1002_ijop-12538.pdf,Union,"BZSG waspositively associated with both classical and modern prej-
udice, but psychological entitlement was only associated
with classical prejudice. BZSG is thus a predictor of gen-eral prejudice, whereas psychological entitlement only
predicts overt prejudice. Our findings are consistent with
other studies (Esses et al., 2001) indicating that perceivedzero-sum competition between groups is strongly impli-cated in negative attitudes to immigration, especially
through manipulation of the inclusiveness of national
identity (see also Smithson, Sopeña, & Platow, 2015)and it is strong predictor of intergroup disagreements
over interdependent goals and interests which can lead to
intractable conflict between contending groups (Bar-Tal,1993; Eidelson & Eidelson, 2003). Current findings are in
line with distinction between patriotism and nationalism
(e.g., Billig, 2002), which posit a differ relationship ofthese both on attitudes towards out-groups. Focusingon own group (present both in patriotism and national-
ism) is not only accompanied by negative attitudes, like
zero-sum thinking or psychological entitlement. There-fore classical social identity theory (Tajfel & Turner,
© 2019 International Union of Psychological ScienceZERO-SUM THINKING AND REFUGEES 7
1979) or self-categorization theory (Turner et al., 1987)
are not sufficient in explanation of relation between
patriotism, nationalism, and acceptance of out-groups
(i.e., refugees in our case). In Ferguson (2009) opinion, for association indices
likerandβrecommended minimum effect size which is
practically significant equals .20; suggested threshold formoderate effect size is .40, and for strong effect size it is
.80. For squared association indices it is respectively .04,
.25, and .64. In our study, we obtained βcoefficients in
the range (of absolute scores) from .04 to .49. Three of
them were below .20 threshold, five between .20 and .40,and one above .40. Therefore only one of obtained indices
was of moderate size."
10-1002_ijop-12538.pdf,Union,"It is hard to compare total effect sizes with associationindices like randβ. Louis et al. (2013) in the path
model explaining negative attitudes towards immigrants
reported total effect of national identification on attitudes
as .08, which is comparable to the effect size found in
current study. Our study was conducted at a specific point in history,
when immigration was starting to be a real social prob-
lem in virtually all European countries. Our data werecollected in Poland, a highly religious, conservative coun-
try (Piurko et al., 2011) with a small proportion of ethnicminority residents. Poland is a member of the European
Union and is thus obliged to help refugees. Moreover,
it is a democratic, affluent society, in which one would
expect negative attitudes to immigrants to be politically
unacceptable. On the other hand, Poland is one of these
European countries, where right-wing parties won last
parliamentary election and nationalistic attitudes seem to
increasing. Our findings suggest that zero-sum thinking could be
under-examined manifestation of national attitudes. Patri-
otism and nationalism are based on different perception
of out-groups—while patriotism is negatively associated
to zero-sum thinking, while nationalism does. That is,
patriotism is weakly negatively associated to competitive
vision of human relations, while nationalism is moder-
ately positively related to thinking about them as com-
petitive and being vulnerable on perceived scarcity of
resources."
10-1002_ijop-12538.pdf,Union,"Second, participants were drawn from het-
erogenous population (i.e., representative sample). Third,
in case of total effects, low results are partially due to
two-level sequential mediation. Moreover, it is commonly assumed that patriotism
and nationalism are predictors of prejudice so the plac-
ing of psychological entitlement and BZSG in the pro-
posed model may seem arbitrary. Psychological entitle-
ment is typically regarded as a variable related to nar-
cissism and high self-esteem (Campbell et al., 2004). As
high self-esteem and narcissism can be present at the age
of seven (Brummelman, Thomaes, & Sedikides, 2016),
and patriotism, nationalism and national identification
are shaped in adolescence (Bar-Tal, 1993), it is possible
that psychological entitlement is prior to national atti-
tudes. However, in the current study we focus of specific
© 2019 International Union of Psychological Science8 PIOTROWSKI ET AL. type of thinking or perception of social world, which is
assumed to follow more stable, general attitudes towardsown nation. In further studies it would be possible tocheck, whether experimental manipulation on activatingzero-sum thinking would lead to increasing levels ofnationalism and decreasing levels of patriotism. Alterna-
tive model, assuming that zero-sum thinking would be a
predictor of attitudes towards own nation was similarlywell fitted to the data, so that our data does not allowruling out possibility that proposed sequence of relation-ship is better than including zero-sum thinking as media-tor between national attitudes and prejudice. On the otherhand, entitlement was unrelated to patriotism in this alter-native model (see Appendix S1, Supporting informationfor details). These limitations should be taken into account when
interpreting our results."
10-1002_ijop-12538.pdf,Union,"BZSG is a promising predictor
of attitude towards out-groups, as it is related to national
attitudes and both forms of prejudice. The relationshipbetween psychological entitlement and prejudice isweaker. It is possible that psychological entitlement ispositively related to prejudice via perceived negativeexchange balance or focusing on self-interest. Thesepossibilities warrant further investigation. Limitationsnotwithstanding, this study sheds light on attitudestowards refugees in a culturally homogenous country,with a strong religious and political tradition. AlthoughPoland is a member of the European Union, attitudes
towards hosting refugees are not positive (14 place in
ranking of 24 countries; O’Rourke & Sinnott, 2006).Educational efforts should emphasise the benefits ofhosting refugees and try to replace a competitive visionof the social world with a social solidarity norm based oncooperative model of social relations. Manuscript received December 2017

in numeracy explain differences in financial (Ghazal,
Cokely, & Garcia-Retamero, 2014; Traczyk et al., 2018)andmedicaldecisionmaking(Petrova,Garcia-Retamero,
Catena, & van der Pligt, 2016). Better decisions in
these domains often involve an accurate estimation ofprobabilities inferred from frequencies (e.g., what is the
probability of experiencing side effects if they occur in 1
outof10patients;whetherthisprobabilityishigherifside
effects occur in 10 out of 100 people). This is especially
importantforpeoplewithlownumeracywhodemonstrateseriousdifficultiesinunderstandingandprocessinginfor-

fore, presenting events in the form of a dynamic streamof stimuli, instead of a static description of the proba-
bility or frequency of these stimuli explicitly expressed
innumbers,mightbeparticularlyhelpfulforpeoplewithlow numeracy. Our experience-based probability format is inspired
by the decision from experience method (Ashby, 2017;Barron & Erev, 2003; Hertwig, Barron, Weber, & Erev,
2004;Traczyket al.,2018;Wulff,Mergenthaler-Canseco,
& Hertwig, 2018) in which people can freely explore theenvironment and learn its properties (e.g., probabilities
and outcomes). 1However, this line of research focused
on choices and decision-making processes rather thancommunication of probability. To our best knowledge, several studies have recently
investigated the effects of an experience-based format
in probability communication (e.g., Armstrong & Span-
iol, 2017; Armstrong, Spaniol, & Persaud, 2018; Tyszka& Sawicki, 2011; Wegier & Shaffer, 2017). We refer
to two studies that examined this effect in more detail. First, in the context of assessing the risk of a geneticdisease, Tyszka and Sawicki (2011) showed that observ-
ing a dynamic sequence of 100 binary events represent-
ing three healthy children and 97 children with genetic

disorders(i.e.,anexperience-based format)producedthe
greatest sensitivity to variations in a probability scale;
it also resulted in less biased affective influences in
comparison to both a scenario format (e.g., three blackballs and 97 white balls shown all at once represent-
ing healthy children and children with genetic disorders,
respectively) and a frequency format (e.g., explicitlydescribed information referring to healthy children and
children with genetic disorders). Second, Armstrong and
Spaniol (2017) showed that an experience-based for-mat improved the estimation of posterior probabilities
(i.e., Bayesian inference) in medical test interpretations. To illustrate, participants experienced joint-frequencydistributions representing a combination of a disease
status and the test result—they were presented with
a series of 100 slides showing patients who had anddid not have a fictitious disease as well as the result
of the diagnostic test (i.e., positive vs. negative test
result). Although the experience-based format improvedthe accuracy of posterior probability estimates in com-
parison to the description-based format, it was not more
helpful topeople withlow vs. high numeracy. To summarise, in the current research we investi-
gated the effect of an experience-based format of pre-
senting probability information and the moderating roleof numeracy. In addition, we attempted to address some
limitations of previous research."

and the consistency of estimates (i.e., lower dispersion
around objective probabilities) among people with low
numeracy. Finally, although participants tended to over-estimate low probabilities and underestimate large prob-
abilities resembling the pattern demonstrated in classic
studies (e.g., Slovic, Fischhoff, & Lichtenstein, 1981),this effect was more flattened (i.e., more linear) in the
experience-basedformat(seeFigure 2),especiallyamong
less numerate participants. This suggests that experience
may lessen distortions in probability weighting (but see
Wulff et al., 2018 for a discussion on over- and under-weighting probabilities in a decision from experience
task)andmayresultinagreatersensitivitytoprobability
variations. Interestingly, and in contrast to results obtained by
Armstrong and Spaniol (2017), we observed a moderat-
ingeffectofnumeracy:inourstudytheexperience-basedformat led to better performance but only among peo-
ple with low numeracy. These results may be driven by
critical differences in the methods between the experi-mentconductedbyArmstrongandSpaniol(2017)andour

10-1002_ijop-12566.pdf,Union,"On the other hand, research has demonstrated that
higher numerical abilities are related to superior perfor-mance in decision tasks because of longer deliberation
(Ghazal et al., 2014; Petrova et al., 2016), the form-
ing of a gist representation of a decision problem(Reyna et al., 2009) and more elaborative process-
ing instead of brute-force optimization processes
(Cokely et al., 2018; Traczyk, Sobkow, etal., 2018). For example, Ashby (2017) recently showed that, in a
decision-from-experience task, more numerate peoplewere more consistent in their choices (i.e., they were
less susceptible to the format [experience vs. descrip-
tion] in which a choice problem was presented), mainlydue to more exhaustive sampling. Importantly, when
sampling difference was removed (Ashby, 2017, Study
2), less and more numerate people did not differ in theconsistency of their choices. In the same vein, our study
shows that the gap between more and less numerate
participants can be eliminated when less numerate par-
ticipants were forced to sample as much information as
morenumerateparticipants(i.e.,theywereprovidedwithfixed sampling, resulting in acquiring the same amount
of information as more numerate participants). Hence,
the experience-based format might also have increasedself-efficacy and motivation to solve problems. That is,
the experience-based format could have initially enabled

numeracytoinvestmoreeffortandcognitiveresourcesto

alsoaddresssomelimitationsofthepresentstudy.Inpar-ticular, more accurate estimates in the experience-basedformat could have been due to the structural differences
between conditions. For example, information was dis-
played either in numbers or symbols that were presentedas summarised events at the same time or a dynamicstream of single events. Even though the frequencies inboth conditions were formally the same, they were dis-played for the same amount of time, and the responsemodewasidentical,someofthesedifferencescouldhaveredirectedparticipants’attentionorinfluencedtheirmoti-vation to give a correct answer.

work. As a result of this integration (i.e., the narcissism
spectrum model), a correspondence between existingmeasures and narcissistic-related core characteristics has
been proposed. In this investigation we used a Spanish
version of the Narcissistic Admiration Rivalry Con-cept operationalisation, that is, NARQ, which providesan opportunity to reliably measure grandiose narcis-
sism divided into two strategies representing its two
expressions, that is, the agentic aspect of admirationand the antagonistic aspect of rivalry (Back, 2018;
Back et al., 2013). The strategy of admiration involves
narcissistic engagement in self-promotion (assertiveself-enhancement) in order to achieve social awe, while
the strategy of rivalry (antagonistic self-protection)
serves as a mean of self-defence to prevent socialfailure (Back et al., 2013)—both of these traits candiffer in ease, strength and frequency (Wetzel, Leck-
elt, Gerlach, & Back, 2016)."

which is among the goals of the current paper. Narcissism and self-esteem share many phenotyp-
ical features like positive self-view (Brummelman,
Thomaes, & Sedikides, 2016), however narcissism,
unlike self-esteem, apart from agentic aspects also com-
prises antagonistic aspects, which are directed against
other people (Back, 2018). Differentiation of admiration
and rivalry already demonstrated that while agentic
aspects are positively related to self-esteem, antagonistic
aspects are relatednegatively (Back et al., 2013). CURRENT STUDY
The main objective of the present study was to test
the structure of narcissism as measured by the Spanish
version of the NARQ (Back et al., 2013). For this pur-
pose,weformulatedthreehypotheses:(1)admirationand
rivalry are reliable in their measurement; (2) the Spanish
version of NARQ is structurally valid and adopts the
second-order factorial structure; (3) the Spanish version
of NARQ is externally valid, that is, admiration is a pos-
itively related to dispositional benign envy, self-esteem,
while rivalry is positively related to the dispositional
malicious envy and negatively related to self-esteem. © 2019 International Union of Psychological ScienceSPANISH ADAPTATION OF THE NARQ 3
Additionally, we aimed to test the differences in admira-
tion and rivalry in samples from other Spanish-speaking
countries, that is, from Chile and Colombia and to com-
pare the structural validity to the original Back et al. (2013) data on German population. For the transparency of our research we would like
to stress that our hypotheses were not preregistered and
ouranalysesonculturaldifferenceswereexploratory.We
would like to encourage other researchers in the field tovalidate our results in similar Spanish-speaking setting.The codebook with complete list of variables as well as

Participants and procedure
Using the data from previous initial NARQ study (Back
et al., 2013), we conducted the Markov-Chain MonteCarlo simulation study to assess the power of parametersin the hypothesised confirmatory factor analysis (CFA)model(assumingtau-equivalencywiththevaluesofresid-
uals set to .50). The results suggested that the sample
size=200 yielded a power >.90 and a sample of =100
yielded a power >.80 for all parameters. Because we
aimed to have at least 10 participants per item (i.e., at
least 180) in the final database, we decided on the >200
threshold."

which subjects respond using 6-point scales rangingfrom 1 (strongly disagree )t o6(strongly agree ). The
scale measures two kinds of envy, that is, dispositional

was close to normal, the distribution for rivalry was
positively skewed and the scores were mostly concen-trated around the mean—indicating that most of the
participants in this Spanish sample rather disagreed
with the more antagonistic expressions. Admiration

for revenge (Grove, Smith, Girard, & Wright, 2019). In
this study, a small amount of gathered information wasdue to measurement error, and the reliability estimates
were similar to those obtained in original and previous
studies on NARQ (Back et al., 2013; Rogoza, Rogoza,et al., 2016a; Vecchione et al., 2018), which altogether
supports the first of the formulated hypotheses stating
that narcissistic admiration and rivalry can be reliably
measured withintheSpanish population. ThesubsequenthypothesispostulatedthattheSpanish
version of the NARQ is structurally valid and adopts the
second-order factorial structure. As in accordance with
prior research (Back et al., 2013; Leckelt et al., 2018;Rogoza, Rogoza, et al., 2016a; Vecchione et al., 2018),
the current study also confirmed the assumed factorial
structureoftheNARQ,successfullyverifyingthehypoth-esis.However,apartfromgeneralgoodmodelfitindices,
we also identified one particular test item that showed
poor performance (i.e., item 16: original version “I man-age to be the center of attention with my outstanding
contributions”; initial Spanish wording “Consigo ser el
centro de atención con mis magníficas aportaciones”). Thepoorefficiencyofthistestitemwasidentifiedthrough
the exploration of the modification indices and was fur-ther confirmed through qualitative assessment in terms
ofcomprehensibilityandculturalaccuracycarriedoutby
four independent Spanish native speakers. Although thecurrent version of NARQ may be successfully used in
Spanish, we recommend rephrasing this item to further
refine its psychometric properties—the proposed refor-mulation of the item: “Puedo ser el centro de atención
gracias a misexcelentes aportaciones.”
Thecorrelationbetweenthesummatedscoresofadmi-

across these populations, there are some substantial cul-

Some limitations are worth mentioning. First, the three

is a need for future studies to provide definitive validity
evidence. To conclude, we have demonstrated that the Spanish
version of NARQ is a reliable and valid measure of nar-cissistic admiration and rivalry. As a result, the NARQ
can be successfully administrated in a wide range of
Spanish-speaking countries and in a variety of research
contexts and designs, although future research is needed
to verify this claim."

five countries (the United States, Poland, France, Mex-
ico and Chile), which differ in many socio-cultural char-
acteristics, to determine whether this scale can be used
validly in different countries, language versions and in
cross-cultural studies. IDENTIFICATION WITH ALL HUMANITY
The idea of the unity of humanity arose as early as the
third century B.C., with the Cynic Diogenes of Sinope
and the Stoic Chrysippus. Within modern psychology,
the concept of identification with humanity appeared inthe theories of Adler, Maslow, Allport and Erikson, as
each regarded caring for the well-being of all humanity
an expression of psychological maturity (for reviews see
Hamer, McFarland, & Penczek, 2019; McFarland et al.,
2019). As Maslow noted, those who have attained the
highestlevelofhumanmaturity“feelkinshipandconnec-
tion, as if all people were members of a single family …
Because of this, self-actualizing people have a genuine
desiretohelpthehumanrace”(Maslow,1954,p.138).In
Turner’s social categorisation theory, the highest, super-
ordinate level is seeing oneself as part of all humanity
(Reicher, Spears, & Haslam, 2010). For a long time, the concept of global human iden-
tification drew little attention from researchers, but thischanged with the beginning of twenty-first century with
a growing number of research studies in this area (for a
broadreviewseeMcFarlandet al.,2019).Inthispaper,we
followtheapproachproposedbyMcFarlandet al.(2012)."
10-1002_ijop-12678.pdf,Union,"Although some studies
of the IWAH suggested only a single factor (McFarland
et al., 2012, 2019), studies by Reese, Proch, and Finn
(2015) in Germany, and by Reysen and Hackett (2016)
in the United States, suggest a two-factor structure. Thefirstfactorconsistsofitems1–4(“Howclosedoyoufeel

the word “we” to refer to [people all over the world]”;
“How much would you say you have in common with

‘family’. To what degree do you think of the following
groups of people as family [people all over the world]”). Thesecondconsistsofitems6–9(“Howmuchwouldyou

“When they are in need, how much do you want to help
[people all over the world]”). Item 5 was excluded fromtheiranalyses asloading on both factors. © 2020 International Union of Psychological ScienceIDENTIFICATION WITH ALL HUMANITY 3
ApplyingLeachet al.’s(2008)multicomponentmodel
of in-group identification, Reese and colleagues called
the two factors “global self-definition” (items 1–4) and
“globalself-investment”(items6–9).Ourdetailedinves-tigation of the items of both measures shows almost no
similarities, however. Furthermore, almost none of the

subscale (“I feel committed to [in-group],” “I feel soli-darity with [in-group]”). We thus argue that Leach et al.’
smodelanditslabelsshouldnotbeappliedtotheIWAH
scale. Reysen and Hackett (2016) named the IWAH factors
“ingroup identification” and “Adler/Maslow.” These
names seem more appropriate, as IWAH is rootedin two lines of theories: the social identity approach
(Reicher et al., 2010) and the personality theories of
Adler (1927/1954) and Maslow (1954). However, webelieve these labels are too ambiguous for the broad
audience.Thus,weproposetocallthefactors“bond”and
“concern” as more informative and clear, also for people
who are not experts inthefield."
10-1002_ijop-12678.pdf,Union,"We also test a bifactor solution (Model 3), because
bifactor and second-order factor models are alternative
approaches to representing general constructs comprised
of highly related domains. “Bifactor models are poten-
tially applicable when (a) there is a general factor that is
hypothesizedtoaccountforthecommonalityoftheitems;
(b) there are multiple domain specific factors, each of
whichishypothesizedtoaccountfortheuniqueinfluence
of the specific domain over and above the general factor;
and (c) researchers may be interested in the domain spe-
cific factors as well as the common factor that is of focal
interest” (Chen et al., 2006, p. 190). We do not think that
the two specific factors are “over and above” the general
factor in the case of IWAH; moreover, the IWAH fac-
tors are correlated. We instead expect Model 2 to be the
best fit to data; however, we include a bifactor model for
comparisons. The question remains of whether the most relevant
structural model of IWAH can be applied to different
countries and cultures. IWAH as a global phenomenon
The majority of studies on IWAH were conducted in the
United States (for a review see McFarland et al., 2019),
but the construct was also positively verified in other
countries,suchasGermany(Reeseet al.,2015),Australia
(Faulkner, 2018) and Poland (Hamer et al., 2017, 2018,

explored in students from 24 countries by Türken and
Rudmin (2013). Moreover, our own analyses of data gathered in 58
countries using the World Value Survey shows that
majority of people in almost all the tested countries seethemselves “as a world citizen” (the only exceptions
wereMorocco,RussiaandEgypt,butonlyinEgyptmore
respondents disagreed than agreed with the statement,
WVS, n.d.). The above studies demonstrate that the idea of seeing

almost all tested countries, not only in the United StatesandotherWesterncultures,andintroducing amorecom-
plexwayofmeasuringhumanidentificationworldwideis
scientificallyjustified.WeagreewithReysenandHackett
(2016) that it is a multifaceted phenomenon that cannotbe reliably measured with only one item."
10-1002_ijop-12678.pdf,Union,"Thus, we have
decided to check applicability of a more complex way of
measuringitindifferentcountries,usingtheIWAHscale. We examine its factorial structure, psychometric proper-
tiesofcross-countryvalidationandreplicability(i.e.mea-surementinvariance)intheUnitedStates,Poland,France,
Mexico and Chile. These countries differ in many ways, such as in
their cultural dimensions, ethnic makeup, national histo-
ries, geographic locations, languages and socio-cultural
characteristics (see more in Hamer et al., 2020; World
Atlas, 2017). For example, in Hofstede’s cultural dimen-sions, Chile is the most collectivistic of these countries,
followed by Mexico, with Poland and France being
more individualistic than collectivistic, and the United
States—very individualistic (Hofstede Insights, n.d.). Similarly, in a newer approach to cultural dimensions,
GLOBE’s dimension of in-group collectivism (“prac-
tices”), which refers to emotional bond with otherin-group members, Mexico and Poland score highly,
whereas the United States and France score significantly
lower (no data for Chile; GLOBE project, n.d.). In
institutional collectivism (“practices”) Poland scores the

highest and France the lowest, while Mexico and the
United States are in between. In Humane orientation,

and rewards individuals for being fair, altruistic, gener-
ous, caring and kind to others, France’s practices scores

with the highest scores for the United States (GLOBE
project, n.d.). Since IWAH scale measures broad social
identifications, these cultural dimensions seem the most
relevant.Additionally,GLOBEputthelistedcountriesindifferent cultural clusters. These countries also differ in the two dimensions
of the Inglehart–Welzel Cultural Map (World Values
Survey, n.d.). In the “traditional” versus “secular ratio-
nal” value dimensions, Mexico is the most “traditional,”
France—the most “secular rational,” and the United
States,PolandandChileareinbetween.Inthe“survival”
versus “self-expression” dimension, the United States
is highest on the “self-expression” side, followed by
Mexico and France, with Chile and Poland closer to
“survival” side. The latter two countries place moreemphasis on economic and physical security and share
a relatively more ethnocentric outlook (World Values
Survey, n.d.), which potentially may hinder developing
broad social identifications."
10-1002_ijop-12678.pdf,Union,"Thus, a test of a measurement invariance indicates
whether the scale can be used in a comparable man-
ner across countries and whether the meaning of a con-
struct is the same. There are three basic levels of mea-surement invariance. (a) Configural or structural equiva-
lence is established if identical latent variables are mea-
sured by the same items in all groups (Van de Vijver
& Poortinga, 2005). This indicates that the construct (as
measured by a scale) is stable and replicable in differ-ent cultural contexts (Davidov et al., 2014). (b) Metric
invariance assumes equal loadings of items on a latent
variable. It indicates that the structure of the latent vari-ableisthesameacrosssamplesandthereforemeaningful
comparisons of the variable’s correlates and predictors

̇Zemojtel-Piotrowska, 2017; Van de Vijver & Poortinga,
2005). (c)Scalarinvarianceindicatesthatcomparisonsinlatent means across countries are possible, and is known
as full equivalence (Van de Vijver & Poortinga, 2005). This level of invariance suggests that the respondents ineachgroupusethescaleinthesameway(Davidovet al.,2014). Boer, Hanke, and He (2018) describe multiple
approachestoestablishingequivalence.Wehavedecided
to use the most common method of testing for mea-
surement invariance—multigroup confirmatory factoranalysis(MGCFA)inAMOS(VandeVijver&Poortinga,2005). Vandenberg and Lance’s (2000) recommend toaccept models if the minimum discrepancy dividedby degrees of freedom (CMIN/ df)<3.00, Root mean
square error of approximation (RMSEA) ≤.080, Stan-
dardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR); ≤.080,
Tucker-Lewis index (TLI) >.90 and Confirmatory Fit
Index (CFI) >.90, however, we will use CMIN/ df<5
which is permissible (see e.g."
10-1002_ijop-12678.pdf,Union,"TESTING THE FACTORIAL STRUCTURE OF
IWAH
In the first step, we conducted confirmatory factor anal-
yses (CFAs) across all countries in order to compare the
three models ( N=1418; see Figure 1). The one factor model originally proposed by McFar-
land(seeFigure 1,Model1)didnotfitthedatafor“pure”

TLI=.73, CFI=0.84, RMSEA =.138, SRMR =.050,
AIC=887.93, ECVI =0.57). In the next step, we tested a second-order model
of one superordinate factor with two subfactors (bond
and concern). The model that included all the items for
“pure” scores fit the data well: 𝜒2=124.20,p<.001,
CMIN/df=4.97,TLI =.96,CFI=0.98,RMSEA =.05,

increase of correlation between factors, we havedecided to delete this item from further analy-
ses, as Reese et al. (2015) and Reysen and Hackett
(2016) postulated. The modified model is the one wehypothesized to fit the data best (see Figure 1, Model 2).The results for “pure” IWAH scores showed that it fitthe data well: 𝜒

because CFI ≤.90, and CMIN/ df>5 indicate lack of fit
(seeTable 3b). Thus, these results support Hypothesis 3, confirming
themetricinvarianceoftheIWAHscaleinregardstoraw
IWAH scores across all five countries and the full scalarinvariance inregards to“pure” IWAH scores. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
IWAH, measured as an individual characteristic, is an
important factor related to social and international rela-tions, such as interest and concern for global issues andhuman rights, prosocial attitudes, intergroup forgiveness,
attitudestowardimmigrants,reactionstohatecrimesand
dehumanisation. For that reason, it seems important toinvestigate this construct in cross-country contexts, as it
may contribute to solving global problems, advancing
human rights and world peace. There has been no previ-ousresearchintotheequivalenceofanyhumanidentifica-
tionscalesandinvariance,whichhaveoftenbeenassumed
butnottested.Therefore,webelievethatthisstudymakesanimportantcontribution,indicatingthatIWAHisacom-mon construct across countries, and that the IWAH scale
maybetranslatedintodifferentlanguagesandusedindif-
ferent cultures."
10-1002_ijop-12678.pdf,Union,"This ensures
the potential for cross-country comparisons in terms of
correlates, predictors and effects of identification withhumanity (both raw and standardised residuals scores),
as well as cross-country comparisons in terms of IWAH
means (standardised residuals measure). Lack of scalar
invariance in raw scores of IWAH may be due to differ-
ences between societies included in the study, the stud-
ied groups and the context (see e.g. Cieciuch, Davidov,
Oberski, & Algesheimer, 2015; Davidov et al., 2018;
Ró̇zycka-Tran et al., 2017). Future studies, conducted
in a greater number of countries, could explore theseissuesfurther. Although our study is limited by its reliance on stu-
dents as participants, comparable student samples are
ideal for cross-country comparisons to confirm the reli-
ability and validity of the scale in different countries, as
inour case (seealsoRó ̇zycka-Tran et al., 2017). © 2020 International Union of Psychological ScienceIDENTIFICATION WITH ALL HUMANITY 9

The results of our study therefore show that IWAH
is a phenomenon that exists among respondents fromthe tested countries. Although our selected countries arevery different in cultural dimensions, ethnic makeup,
national histories, languages, geographic locations and
socio-cultural characteristics, all are predominantlyChristian and therefore may be seen as sharing somesimilarities that potentially stem from this religion. Inorder to establish the universality of the construct and
IWAH as a way of measuring it, future studies should
aim to include more countries, particularly those withvery different religious backgrounds, such as Confucianor Hindu. The relevance of studying and developing IWAH
worldwide is of growing importance, especially in ourworld fighting global problems, such as climate change,refugee crisis and pandemic of COVID-19. Earlier
research shows that collectivisation in a time of emer-
gencyincreasesthechancestosurvive.Collectiveidentitymitigates against damaging behaviours, leads to positiveactions, helps coordinate and create collective sourcesof support (Drury et al., 2019; Drury, Reicher, & Stott,
2020)."
10-1002_ijop-12678.pdf,Union,"In our era of the Internet does IWAHchange the way people cope with stress during the timeofsocial distancing? Chinese businessman Jack Ma donated supplies to
several countries being hit by the coronavirus, includ-ing Japan, Korea, Italy, Iran and Spain. In his state-ment, he said “ The crisis presents a huge challenge to
all humankind in a globalized world. The pandemic we
face today can no longer be resolved by any individ-ual country ” (Ward, 2020). The Japanese government,
companies and private people donated money and med-
ical supplies to aid China and showed their support in
many other ways. On the crates with supplies they wrotequotesfromChinesepoems,suchas“ Wearefromdiffer-
entlandsandareseparatedbymountainsandwaters.Yetabove us, we share the same sky and the same feelings ”
(Chong,2020).TheChinesetechnologycompanyXiaomi

mailed a shipment of masks protecting from coronavirus
totheItaliangovernmentstaplingsidesofthecrateswithan ancient line of poetry from the Roman philosopher,Seneca: “We are waves from the same sea, leaves from
thesametree,andflowersfromthesamegarden ”(Shiyue,
2020). Apart from different motivations that could stand
behind these donations, the quotes are clear manifesta-tions of the idea being a core of IWAH, and it is not afortuity. In a face of global threats, humanity needs tostandtogethertosurvive.Itseemsthatstudyinganddevel-oping IWAH worldwide has never been more important. CONCLUSIONS
To date there were no studies of the cross-country vali-
dation and replicability of any measure of global humanidentification. Thus, our research brings important con-tribution in this area, showing the IWAH scale’s utilityin measuring such a broad identification in differentcountries. In this paper, we showed that the IWAH scaledisplaysfullinvarianceacrossfivecountriesandlanguageversions for “pure” IWAH scores (controlling for sharedvariance with local and national identifications) and
metricinvarianceforrawIWAHscores.Thisissufficient
to allow a comparison of correlates and predictors ofthe scale in different countries (for both type of IWAHscores) and a comparison of means for “pure” IWAHscores."

can at times be perceived almost as if they were

human characteristics is called anthropomorphism

ing to moral typecasting theory (MTT), moral interac-tions emerge within a moral dyad, which consists of a
moral patient and a moral agent (Gray & Wegner, 2009). In the relationship between moral agents and patients,a moral patient is subject to moral actions, both good
and evil, carried out by a moral agent (Gray, 2010). However, the relationship between both is asymmetri-cal. That is, agents require mental capacities that sup-

et al., 2010c), whereas patients suffer the effects of the
agents’ actions, and therefore need a capacity to feel(i.e. experience; Waytz et al., 2010c). Attributions of experi-ence differentiate the perceptions of humans and robotsparticularly well (Gray et al., 2007; Gray & Wegner,
2012a). Previous research has demonstrated that participants
who read about intentional infliction of harm onto aliminally minded moral patient (e.g. a vegetative statepatient), spontaneously attributed more mind to thepatient (Ward et al., 2013). This effect, labelled the
harm-mademind , has been explained on the basis of the
patient’s mere participation in a dyadic moral interaction(Ward et al., 2013)."

tric shocks stings worse (Gray & Wegner, 2008), as do
intentional insults (Gilbert et al., 2004). In MTT, suchfindings could be explained by an even greater asym-
metry of mind attributions in the moral dyad if harm is
caused intentionally rather than accidentally (cf., Gray& Wegner, 2009). In consequence, even more agency
should be attributed to intentionally harmful agents,
and an even greater capacity for experience should begranted to intentionally harmed patients. This, how-
ever, appears to contrast with certain findings estab-
lished by dehumanisation theory. Accordingly, harm-
ful agents should rather be perceived to be lessagen-
tive than benevolent agents (Khamitov et al., 2015).For example, offenders may be deniedmental capaci-
ties closely related to both agency and patiency (Bas-
tian et al., 2013)—and people themselves report feelingless human after having behaved immorally (Kouchaki

The present study aimed to contrast predictions made
by MTT and dehumanisation theory from a differentangle than in the previous study by Khamitov et al.(2015). Notably, we concentrated on mind attribution tomoral patients. We chose to examine a human and arobotic avatar to compare two entities of moderate tohigh human-likeness,
1wherein the human avatar should
be perceived as possessing a mind to begin with. First,in line with MTT and the harm-made mind effect, we
hypothesised that the robotic avatar would be attributed
more mind (experience) in a harm context, whereas thehuman avatar should be victimised (i.e."

more morally right in this comparison, but here the dif-
ference between the two types of avatars appeared to be
less pronounced ( Mbenevolent,human =5.07,SD=1.53 vs.
Mbenevolent,robot =4.35,SD=1.41;p=.014). Together,
these results appeared to be consistent with the notion
of our second hypothesis, that is, that benevolent inten-
tions should lead to rehumanisation, whereas malevolent
intentions fosterdehumanisation. To further clarify the understanding of intentions
in this type of visual vignettes, we conducted a brief
follow-up study with 28 participants (11 women;
Mage=37.71,SD=10.09). It revealed that 100% of

accompanied by a significant total indirect effect of pain

contrast between them did not demonstrate a significant
difference(CI =[−.16,.29]).Thus,consistentwithprevi-
ous findings, harm done to a moral patient affected mind
perception through perceived pain as a mediator (Wardet al., 2013). In addition, in the present study, empa-thy was found to be an equally effective mediator of
increased mind perception. This finding might be due to
the visual nature ofour materials that may have renderedharm more salient than traditional text-based vignettes.Takentogether,theseresultssuggestthatperceivedcapac-
ity for pain and participants’ reported empathy with the

mind perception with the same mediation model as for
avatar type and harm. Here, however, the consistent pat-tern of results found for the previous models could notbereplicated. 5Therefore,weexploredthepossibilitythat
in the case of the relationship between intentions and
mind perception, pain and empathy acted as confound-ing variables."

a facial wound resulted in enhanced mind attribution,

for being imbued with negative social value (see Sher-
man & Haidt, 2011), visible harm appeared to humaniseboth kinds of entities in terms of their perceived men-
tal and emotional capacities. Importantly, these response
tendencies emerged similarly for both the robotic andthe human-like avatar, supporting media equation views
that humans may overall react similarly to humans as
theyreacttowardshumans(e.g.Rosenthal-vonderPütten
et al.,2013). Nevertheless, our results also demonstrate that mind
attribution and empathy expressed towards artificial enti-
ties are highly malleable and responsive to subtle social
cues. The human-like avatars were perceived to pos-sess a greater level of mind, as more capable of expe-
riencing pain and emotions, elicited more empathy, and
were dehumanised to a lesser degree. Furthermore, there

was one notable exception to the general pattern of
main effects: Participants reported a stronger contrast
between right and wrong when the moral patient was a
human-like avatar. Thus, while humans may generallyperceive humans and human-like robots in a very similar
manner, they also appeared to be biased towards fellow
humans in that higher moral standards were applied tomorehuman-likevictims.Thisfindingappearsconsistent

central a role for “mind infusion” effects as claimed
by previous work on the harm-made mind (e.g. Wardet al., 2013)."
10-1002_ijop-12715.pdf,Union,"Malle & Knobe, 1997). However, aswithpriorresearchontheharm-made mind,
work in this area has predominantly been shaped bypurely text-based analyses. Here, extended work on
image-based representations could help illuminate under
which conditions brief non-verbal observations in the
real world are, for example perceived as blameworthy
intentional norm violations (Monroe & Malle, 2017), oras side-effect actions (Malle & Knobe, 1997). Despite these encouraging results, the present work
still faces a number of limitations. First, all of ourmeasures were based on simple self-report data that

thermore, our current results are based on a single visual
vignette study that could not fully account for a numberof possible alternative accounts and ambiguities inherentto this approach. As demonstrated by the results of thepost test, participants were able to clearly distinguishbetween benevolent and malevolent intentions, and theyrecognisedthetaserandthefloweraccordingly.However,we do not know what specific kind of benevolent inten-tions were perceived by participants, or if other types ofsignals of socio-moral intentions might have been more
effective. For example, participants may have interpreted
our without-harm malevolent intentions somewhat morebroadly as a situation where “harm is coming” ratherthan specifically as an abstract goal-directed intentionto cause harm. Nevertheless, we believe that even suchgeneralisations and variations would still capture the gistof the difference between a clear and imminent sense of(intentional)harmthatmightperhapsstillbeaverted,andactualphysicalharmthathasalreadyoccurred.Likewise,the precise sequence of events resulting in harm to thepatient was left to the imagination of the participant."

Mobile phone addiction is a robust phenomenon observed throughout the world. The social aspect of mobile phone
use is crucial; therefore, phubbing is a part of the mobile phone addiction phenomenon. Phubbing is defined as

The goal of this study was to provide evidence for mea-
surement invariance across countries and for gender ofthe Phubbing Scale in samples from different countries. Phubbing Scale was primarily developed in a Turkish
studybyKarada ˘getal. (2015).Itwasoriginallymodelled
in two dimensions based on classical conditioning the-

determined that both, the theoretical and data-focused
approach of the draft scale, confirmed each other. We hypothesised that the meaning and structure of all
the scale items were similar in all countries where data
was gathered. That would indicate the factor validity of
scale, which in turn would allow for future performance
ofmultilevelmodellinganalyses.Ourmainemphasiswas
the measurement invariance, because it points towards

sian(Zamanietal.,2020),Indonesian(Latifaetal.,2019),
Italian (Guazzini et al., 2019) and Ukrainian (Ivanova
et al., 2020). There is evidence that cultural factors
play an important role in behaviours related to new
media such as Facebook use or addiction (Abbas &
Mesch, 2015; Błachnio et al., 2016; Qiu et al., 2013),
Internetuseoraddiction (Błachnio etal.,2017; Błachnio

First, goodness-of-fit was tested for the two-factor of
Phubbing Scale structure based on two-level CFA, with
group-meancentering,tocontrolanybetween-groupvari-
ability across the countries in testing for the validity offactorial structure. We used MLR estimator because of
an abnormal distribution of items. The two-factor model
was poorly fitted to within-level data, as indicated by

RMSEA =.121, SRMR =.096. Intraclass correlations
and within-level standardised factor loadings are pre-sented in Table 1. The refined two-factor model (with-out poorly loaded item 5 and item 10) was well fittedto data within-level: MLR χ

(p<.001), CFI =.657, TLI =.559, RMSEA =.092,
SRMR=.083. Further,wealsocalculatedCFAsforthe8-itemmodel,

nearly all the countries, with two exceptions of Pakistan
(CFI=.886) and Serbia (RMSEA =0.134), some of the

student sample makes a relevant comparison with other
studies that recruited from within a similar population(Hamer et al., 2021). Therefore, our study contributes toa greater body of research on cross-cultural comparisonand testingthe reliabilityofthe scale. In future research, caution should be applied when
generalising the student sample to the whole population.Moreover, it may be worth re-examining a relationshipbetween phubbing and age, with more age-differentiatedsamples; the correlation may prove to be much strongerthan that found in the current study. Finally, it is alsoimportant to note an uneven participant representationfrom the countries on different continents."

English version of the scale being used there, rather than
a translation to the national language, which could havemeant a poor understanding of some items. Despite these limitations, we can express several
salient findings. To our knowledge, the analyses weapplied are novel in the literature that shows theinvariance of Phubbing Scale. The results indicatethat Phubbing Scale demonstrates good psychometricpropertieswithinthe18countries(Belarus,Brazil,China,Croatia,Ecuador,India,Israel,Italy,Netherlands,Poland,Portugal,Slovakia,Slovenia,Spain,Turkey,UK,Ukraineand USA). The results also indicate that Phubbing Scalecan be used in cross-cultural studies for between-groupcomparisons of within-group correlations of phubbingand other variables. This is especially relevant, given

in developing research-based knowledge. Recent pub-lications have inferred that there is a need to promote
systematic approaches and replication efforts (Koole &
Lakens, 2012; Open Science Collaboration, 2015). CONCLUSIONS
Our research has shown the potential of Phubbing Scale
to maintain metric equivalence across cultures due to thecross-culturalstudiesconducted.Aswithanyotherques-tionnaire, researchers using Phubbing Scale in cultures
otherthanthosetestedwiththeintentionofcross-cultural
comparison,shouldadditionallytestforequivalence.Pos-sible reasons for poor or low equivalence could be: (a)poorlytranslateditems,(b)poorqualityofdatacollected,
(c) low motivation of respondents, etc. In Summary, we aimed at investigating whether the
structure of the phubbing phenomenon was the same indifferent cultures. Moreover, we intended to check the
cultural invariance that would give us the possibility of
using the tool in cross-cultural comparisons."

industrial and commercial base, and a poor infr astructure. In contrast, developed economies 
are characterized by high standards of living, a robust industrial and commercial base, and a 
well-developed infrastructure (R oztocki and Weistroffer 2008b). For a country or a region, the key factor for the move from developing to developed 
status is strong and continuous economic growth (Roztocki and Weistroffer 2011b). In 
essence, this economic growth enables an ec onomy to gradually close the gap between the 
developed world by increasing standards of living, developing a competitive industrial and 
commercial base, and improving infrastructure. Many of the emerging economies are also transition economies, which are defined as 
economies that are in a long-term transition process from a communist style central planning 
system to a free market system (Roztocki and Weistroffer 2008a). Most of these economies 
were former countries of the former Eastern Bloc or resulted from the breakup of the Soviet Union (Roztocki and Weistroffer 2011a). Despite many Information and Communication Technology (ICT) investments being 
conducted in emerging economies (including transition economies), the mainstream 
Information Systems (IS) research widely disreg ards unique economic, social and regulatory 
aspects prevalent in these countries (Roztocki and Weistroffer 2009; Roztocki and Weistroffer 2011b). The scarcity of published research on the topic of ICT management in emerging 
economies provides motivation for this special issue. The papers included in this special issue 
were selected from the best papers presented at the First International Conference on ICT 
Management for Global Competitiveness and Economic Growth in Emerging Economies (ICTM 2012) in Wroclaw, Poland, Septembe r 17-18, 2012. Frequently, papers from such 
events hosted in emerging economies provide especially valuable insights, as the events 
attract authors who live and work in emerging economies (including transition economies) 
and who are therefore familiar with its unique economic, social and regulatory aspects 
(Roztocki and Weistroffer 2013). 1.1 Developed, Transition, Emerging and Developing Economies 
The objective of this section is to discuss the differences between the four types of countries 
(developed, transition, emerging and developing economies) and examine the impact of 
computer ownership, internet access, education etc."

10-1002_jts5-69.pdf,Union,"Those authors sug-
gested that national collective narcissism brought the Nazi regime to power in Germany in the 1930s (Adorno, 1997; Fromm, 1964, 1973, 1980). Current research links national collective narcissism to support 
for populist parties and politicians in various countries in the world (for meta-analysis of the relationship, see Forgas & Lantos, 2019). American collective narcissism was the second, after partisanship, strongest predictor of voting for Donald Trump in the 2016 U.S. Presidential election. Its role was compared to other factors, while explaining support for Trump's candidacy: economic dissatisfac -
tion, authoritarianism, sexism, and racial resentment. National collective narcissism was associated with the voters' decision to support Donald Trump over and above those variables (Federico & Golec de Zavala, 2018). In the United Kingdom, collective narcissism was associated with the vote to leave the European Union. Rejection of immigrants, perceived as a threat to economic superiority and the British way of life were behind the associa -
tion between collective narcissism and the Brexit vote (Golec de Zavala, Guerra, & Simão, 2017). In addition, collective narcissism predicted support for the populist government and its particular policies in Poland (Cislak, Wojcik, & Cichocka,  2018; Marchlewska, 4  |    
GOLEC dE ZAVALA And KEE nAn
Cichocka, Panayiotou, Castellanos, & Batayneh, 2018) and in 
Hungary (Forgas & Lantos, 2019). Collective narcissism is not just a positive belief about one's 
own group. It is a belief that the group is unique  and exceptional , 
and therefore, entitled  to privileged treatment. However, even with 
the reference to a national group, collective narcissism is not sim -
ply another name for nationalism as defined and assessed in psy -
chological research (for a detailed discussion of the difference see Golec de Zavala, 2018; Golec de Zavala, Dyduch-Hazar, et al., 2019, for latent factor analysis see Federico & Golec de Zavala, 2020)."
10-1002_jts5-69.pdf,Union,"Polish collective narcissists reject Polish homosexuals. Collective narcissism is related to over-exclusion of homosexual co-nationals because it is associated with the belief that homosex -
uality is a threat to national values (defined by teachings of tradi -
tional Catholicism, Golec de Zavala, Mole, & Lantos, 2020; Mole, Golec de Zavala, & Adraq, 2020) and “contamination” of national identity. Polish collective narcissism is also associated with sexism (among men and women) driven by the belief that the traditional gender hierarchy expressed national values and questioning of those hierarchies threatens national identity (Golec de Zavala & Bierwiaczonek, 2020). In this way, collective narcissism is related to a motivation to maintain a specific in-group prototype (e.g., Pinto, Marques, & Paez, 2016). National collective narcissism harms the nation not only by in -
tensifying internal divisions and exacerbating existing inequalities, it but also predicts support for policies that are harmful to the national in-group but serve as an expression of national identity defined by collective narcissism. In Poland, national collective nar -
cissism is associated with support for anti-environmental policies (Cislak et al., 2018) and policies that harm strategic and economic position of Poland (i.e., leaving the European Union; Cislak, Pyrczak, Mikewicz, & Cichocka, 2019). In Indonesia, national collective narcis -
sism interacted with group tightness (intolerance of deviance from group norms) in mediating the link between religious fundamental -
ism and extreme group behavior (willingness to die for one's group) (Yustisia, Putra, Kavanagh, Whitehouse, & Rufaedah, 2020). In the intergroup context, collective narcissism predicts hostile 
intergroup attitudes and behaviors in retaliation to offences to the in-group's image, past and present, actual, and imagined (Golec de Zavala, Dyduch-Hazar, et al., 2019). Importantly, collective narcis -
sism is associated with hypersensitivity to any signs the in-group is lacking recognition: in-group criticism (Golec de Zavala et al., 2016), threat from hostility of other groups (Dyduch-Hazar, Mrozinski, & Golec de Zavala, 2019), and distinctiveness threat––the threat that the in-group is not recognized as unique in comparison to other groups (Guerra et al., 2019). Collective narcissists exaggerate such threats and interpret them as a provocation to which they respond aggressively. Another line of research exemplifies the same mechanism in a 
different way."

DOI: 10.1002/peractivities. Frequencies of activities during the past year were
measured retrospectively by the Oregon Avocational InterestScales (Goldberg, 2010). The Oregon Avocational Interest
Scales includes items describing activities in various life do-
mains, excluding work and school. Skimina et al. (2018) cat-egorized these activities into 20 clusters, for instance, ‘Drank
in a bar or night club ’is an example of drinking and partying,
‘Cleaned the house ’is an example of housekeeping, and
‘Read the comics to a child ’is an example of childcare. The highest correlates of Alpha/Stability were found for the
activities classi ﬁed as household ( r= .33), drinking alcohol
and partying ( r=/C0.29), gardening ( r= .29), religious prac-
tices ( r= .26), Internet dating ( r=/C0.24), and childcare
(r= .24), and the highest correlates of Beta/Plasticity were
found for sur ﬁng the Internet ( r= .45), physical activity
(r= .40), travelling ( r= .32), reading ( r= .39), music
(r= .31), drinking alcohol and partying ( r= .30), game-
playing ( r= .28), and creative hobbies ( r= .31). The limited number of studies conducted with the purpose
of analysing the relationships between personality metatraitsand speci ﬁc behaviours might be a consequence of an expec-
tation that the similarity of the predictor and the criterion in the
range of generality increases correlation between the formerand the latter (Funder, 2009). From this point of view, it is bet-
ter to use narrow rather than broad personality constructs to
predict speci ﬁc behaviours. However, some studies suggest
that metatraits might be comparable or even better than nar-
row traits in the prediction of some behaviours. For instance,
Alessandri and Vecchione (2012) showed that Stabilityaccounted for variance in job performance beyond that of
the Big Five."

In the present paper, we investigated the link between
stereotype threat, school achievement, and domain identi-
fication in language arts. We hypothesized that stereotype
threat may lead to higher intellectual helplessness, lower
working memory capacity, lower achievement, and domain
identification but only in young men highly identified withtheir gender group. To test these assumptions we used
self ‐descriptive measures of stereotype threat, intellectual
helplessness, gender identification, and domain identifica-
tion. We also evaluated working memory capacity by
working memory test and school achievement using grade
point average. Our predictions were tested in structural
equation modeling on a nationwide sample of 319 youngmen from coeducational schools, aged 14 –16 years. The
results revealed that working memory was a mediator of
achievement ( γ= 0.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [0.34,
0.55]), while intellectual helplessness was related to both
domain identification ( γ=−0.13, 95% CI = [ −0.22, −0.04])
and achievement ( γ=−0.13, 95% CI = [ −0.21, −0.06])."

To conclude, we have contributed to previous studies on stereotype threat by showing that the conceptualization
of stereotype threat as a chronic phenomenon has a predictive value to both school achievement and domainidentification by two relatively separate mechanisms. The first mechanism is based on intellectual helplessness and
leads to domain disengagement, the second involves working memory deficits and leads to lower language
achievement. Although the present research was correlational, the examination of two mediational routes in onemodel —with a new mediator (i.e., intellectual helplessness) —offers an important contribution to understanding the
long ‐term consequences of chronic stereotype threat in school settings. The value of this information can be seen
in its potential for guiding interventions to reduce the chronic effects of stereotype threat. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

In sum, familiarity as a result of exposure to the specific musical material is unlikely to be responsible for the observed differences between musicians and non-musicians. Nevertheless, it is still possible that musicians were more exposed to the specific musical stimuli without leading to a change in familiarity ratings, or to music of the same musi-cal genre. Hence, a further study should be conducted in the future, in which the effects of music and speech distractors are corroborated with unfamiliar material.

on the other hand, the attendance frequency may not be able to discriminate well 
enough between the highly religious and those that mostly attend to follow local 
traditions. This was found in the context of 1970s Spain (Adserà 2006a), and it 
applies to Poland in our research. In such contexts, the less religious are a poten-
tially selected group. It would have been appropriate for these contexts to further 
differentiate those highly religious people into more nuanced categories. For exam-
ple, it could be suggested to create a category of “people with a very high religios-
ity”, who attend religious services more often than weekly. This approach would not 
have worked in less religious contexts, however, as the number of cases in this very 
highly religious group would have been too small to be analysed. Notably, in our 
results we did not find differences in the likelihood of getting significant effects in 
different religious contexts, suggesting that the problem of selected groups did not 
affect our results in any significant way and supporting our choice of grouping the 
attendance frequency into the three categories. Moreover, as we focused on Chris-
tian denominations most of all, the frequency of attending religious services is likely 
to be interpreted in a comparable way across countries and carries a similar meaning 
among our respondents (Brenner 2016). Nevertheless, other measures of religiosity 
could be tested in future studies to corroborate our findings. Similarly, future research could examine other stages of the fertility decision-
making process besides fertility intentions, such as fertility ideals or behaviour. Due 
to the persistence of the two-child “ideal” in Europe, parity-specific effects might 
also be expected (Sobotka and Beaujouan 2014), meaning that the relationship 
between religiosity and fertility and the influence of the gender regime could be par -
ity-specific."

between visual search performance and autistic traits, we did find several other and rather expected relations. Specifically, overall performance increased with age (9–14 years), and higher average full-scale IQ (and particularly higher scores on the subscale Coding; see Supplementary Tables 1) were associated with faster reaction times during the visual search task. Conclusions
Taken together, our behavioural and eye tracking data from 608 children failed to support the hypothesis that higher autistic traits in the general population is associated with better performance in visual search.

Abstract
Early services for ASD need to canvas the opinions of both parents and professionals. These opinions are seldom compared in the same research study. This study aims to ascertain the views of families and professionals on early detection, diagnosis and intervention services for young children with ASD. An online survey compiled and analysed data from 2032 respond-ents across 14 European countries (60.9% were parents; 39.1% professionals). Using an ordinal scale from 1 to 7, parents’ opinions were more negative (mean = 4.6; SD 2.2) compared to those of professionals (mean = 4.9; SD 1.5) when reporting 
satisfaction with services. The results suggest services should take into account child’s age, delays in accessing services, and active stakeholders’ participation when looking to improve services."
10-1007_s10803-019-04253-0.pdf,Union,"2019). These surveys are based on large proportion of responses and they constitute a cost-effectiveness procedure for the analysis of the situation and hypothesis generation, even though they fail providing inferences free of bias. However, they are excellent tools when analysing a large and diverse population. Although the opinions and satisfaction of families and 
professionals with early detection, diagnosis, and early inter -
vention services seem to have played a fundamental role in changing policies and improving services for the ASD community, the perspectives of these two different groups have rarely been considered together. Hence, it is important to obtain detailed information about the type of services which young children with ASD receive and the views held by various European stakeholders on such services, in order to inform the decisions of policy makers -at both a national and European level- affecting the financing of services and training of families and professionals. To this end, we used the Autism Spectrum Disorder in 
the European Union (ASDEU 2015–2018) network to con-duct a multinational study aimed at assessing and collecting the opinions and attitudes of the autism community (fami-lies and professionals) concerning early detection, diagno-sis and intervention services for children with ASD under 9 years of age in 14 European countries. More specifically, our objectives with regard to early detection, diagnosis and intervention services were: (a) to identify the types of ser -
vices received by children with ASD in Europe; (b) to exam-ine families’ and professionals’ degree of satisfaction with services across Europe; (c) to explore variations in age at detection, diagnosis and intervention and delays in accessing services, as reported by parents and professionals; and lastly (d) to identify the variables that predict service satisfaction in both groups. Methods
Survey Development
The development of the surveys was carried out in three steps. The first was a focus group activity aimed at obtain-ing initial direct information about the perceptions and ideas of people normally involved in the processes of detection, diagnosis and early intervention of children with ASD. This information helped us to delimit the content and topics of interest that we were going to include in the surveys. The second step focused on the development of the items and the structure of the questionnaires."

Abstract
Research providing an evidence-base for autistic adult services is sparse. The Autism Spectrum Disorders in the European 
Union (ASDEU) network implemented an on-line survey to determine gaps in autistic adult diagnostic evaluation and post-
diagnostic support services. More than 55% in all groups experienced most of the recommended features for diagnostic 
evaluation for autistic adults. In contrast, < 2% of adults or carers, and < 21% of professionals experienced each of the recom-
mended features for post-diagnostic support. In contrast to 61% of professionals, only about 30% of autistic adults and carers 
had knowledge of good local services models for autism diagnosis in adulthood. There are major differences between good 
practice guidelines for diagnostic and post-diagnostic care for autistic adults, and what is actually experienced by services 
users and professionals. Keywords Autism spectrum disorder · Adults · Diagnosis · Services
Autism Spectrum Disorder is a lifelong, neurodevelopmen-
tal condition characterized by deficits in social communica-
tion and interaction, and restricted, repetitive repertoires of 
behavior, interests and activities (Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders-fifth edition; DSM-5 2013; 
Howlin et al."

The present study aimed to explore the real-world knowl-
edge and experiences in diagnostic evaluation and the post-
diagnostic support services for autistic adults in Europe Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders 
1 3
and if the experiences were consistent with guidelines and 
recommendations, in order to identify gaps and opportuni-
ties for improvement. Information was gathered via an on-
line survey exploring the experiences of current services 
practices for autistic adults. The survey was carried out by 
researchers working within the Autism Spectrum Disorder 
in the European Union (ASDEU 2015–2018) network, a 
collaboration of 11 European countries (http://asdeu .eu/). The data were used to compare perceptions and experi-
ences of (1) autistic adults, (2) carers of autistic adults and 
(3) professionals in adult services, to determine the degree 
of alignment between the respondents’ actual experiences 
of services and published guidelines. With these data we 
hoped to identify potential target areas for improving the 
diagnostic processes and post-diagnostic support in addi-
tion to informing policy in this area. Method
Survey Development
Survey questions were based upon a variety of published 
guidelines and recommendations regarding services for 
autistic adults (Autism Europe 2013; Kendall et al. 2013; 
National Audit Office 2009; NICE 2012, 2014a, b, 2016; 
Think Autism: Updating the 2010 Adult Autism Strategy) 
which describe quality standards for health and social ser -
vices for autistic adults and associated approaches for the 
evaluation and profiling of needs and gaps in services for 
autistic adults. Response options for many questions were 
developed to reflect how closely respondents believed that 
the local services that they had experienced ‘fit’ these rec-
ommendations."
10-1007_s10803-021-04873-5.pdf,Union,"We cannot determine if or how results would change if we had more precise information 
on the timing of diagnosis vis a vis the 2012 guidelines and 
could limit our analysis to those respondents who were diag-
nosed after 2012. Nevertheless, what is most striking even 
in the sensitivity analysis results is the relatively high pro-
portion of respondents who experienced the recommended 
diagnostic evaluation practices versus the relatively low 
proportion of respondents—especially adults and carers—
who experienced the recommended post-diagnostic support 
practices. The results suggest a gap in the alignment between 
best practices and actual experiences in the diagnosis versus 
post-diagnosis services process. Further study is warranted 
to determine if, to date, the gap has narrowed, or possibly 
disappeared. It is also crucial to note again that the survey results were 
derived from a convenience sample and it is not known 
how well this represents the experience of these groups in 
the European population. Therefore, results may be best 
considered as a robust ‘pilot study’, providing an overall 
impression of the state of autistic adult services across dif-
ferent areas of the European Union. Therefore, results and 
interpretation of data warrant follow-up for confirmation in 
well-powered and well-designed scientific studies recruit-
ing larger sample sizes. Being a convenience sample, the 
present study also has the potential for selection bias in the 
recruitment of respondents, e.g., access to the online survey 
was restricted to people with internet access, contacts with 
local associations and respondents who were motivated to 
respond may not be representative of all services users or 
professionals. The autistic adults and the adults described by 
carers may not be directly comparable since the ages, gender 
distribution and the degree of independence of these two 
groups appeared to be different. We also do not know the 
specific circumstances around the diagnosis of the autistic 
adults (i.e., provider discipline; type of service) which may 
both validate and impact the diagnosis and post-diagnosis 
experiences reported by them. Also, experiences of services reported by users versus  
professionals may not be directly comparable since profes-
sionals’ perceptions were based on a large sample of expe-
riences while users’ perceptions were limited to their own 
personal experience."

The ASDEU survey provided a rich overview of the state

of autism diagnostic services for adults varied considerably 
by respondent group and adult characteristic but notably less 
than half of respondents reported that the information on 
how to get a diagnosis was easy to find or to understand and 
knowledge of local diagnostic models that work well for 
autistic adults was generally low. In particular, the results 
indicated variation in the degree of alignment between pub-
lished guidelines for services and care for autistic adults and 
what is actually experienced by services users and services 
professionals. The alignment between real-world experi-
ences and published guidelines was closest for the diagnos-
tic assessment process while the outlook for post-diagnostic 
support was much poorer, especially from the perspectives 
of autistic adults and carers. Discrepancies between actual 
service experiences and recommendations for services 
could serve as a guide for what questions to ask and where 
to focus future effort concerning diagnostic autistic adult 
services. Differences by gender or degree of independence 
of autistic adults in diagnostic services and post-diagnostic 
support experiences highlight the need to consider these 
important factors in future studies of autistic adult services."

Abstract
The Autism Spectrum Disorders in the European Union (ASDEU) survey investigated local services’ use experiences of 
autistic adults, carers and professionals with interventions for autistic adults. The majority of the 697 participants experi-
enced recommended considerations prior to deciding on intervention and during the intervention plan and implementation. Psychosocial interventions were the most commonly experienced interventions, while pharmacological interventions NOT 
recommended for core autistic symptoms were reported by fairly large proportions of participants. Family interventions were 
experienced slightly more commonly by carers than adults or professionals. Less than the 26% of autistic adult responders 
who had experienced challenging behaviors reported receiving an intervention to change them. These results provide insights 
for improving gaps in service provision of interventions among autistic adults."

Introduction
The autistic condition is characterized by deficits in social 
communication and interaction, and restricted/repetitive 
repertoires of behaviors, interests and activities (Autism 
Spectrum Disorder, American Psychiatric Association, 
2013) and usually persists into adulthood (Howlin et al., 
2004, 2013; Woolfenden et al., 2012). Good practices using 
autistic adult-specific long-term treatments, however, are 
mostly unexplored. The Autism Spectrum Disorders in the 
European Union (ASDEU) project conducted a survey to 
collect information on services availability and experience related to autistic adult interventions in 11 European coun-
tries with the overall aim of determining how services for 
interventions were delivered to autistic adults. In particular, 
the present project aimed to investigate how well or how 
widely recommendations for autistic adults’ interventions 
were implemented in practice in community settings. Survey 
respondents were autistic adults, carers of autistic adults, 
and professionals in adult services. Questions concerned 
recommended items to consider when deciding on an inter -
vention for autistic adults, factors of positive intervention 
outcomes and factors to be considered when deciding on an 
intervention for challenging behavior such as self-harm or 
injury to others. In addition, the survey explored the use of 
psychosocial and pharmacological interventions, and family 
interventions for members of an adult’s family. In adulthood, some of the most relevant challenges that 
prompt interventions arise from core symptoms (i.e., repeti-
tive/restricted behaviors; deficits in social skills) and poor 
adaptive functioning that may impede independent living, Maria Luisa Scattoni and Diana Schendel are equally contributing 
authors."

ties, further development of adult intervention services is a 
current priority for many stakeholders ranging from autistic

123An important ﬁnding that indicates the importance attached to the extrinsic value of
ﬁnancial success by men appears to be inconsistent with the hypotheses proposed here,with the results of earlier research (e.g. Kasser and Ryan 1993 ,1996 ), and with the
assumptions of SDT (Deci and Ryan 2002 ). There are at least two ways in which to
interpret this result. One of them is to scrutinize the cultural and socioeconomic situation ofthe examined population. The standard of living in Poland is substantially lower than that enjoyed by people in the
USA or Germany (GDP per capita in the USA and Germany is more than twice the level in
Poland; e.g. based on the data by World Bank 2014 ; OECD 2014 ), Poland also being one
of the poorest members of the European Union (World Bank 2014 ; OECD 2014 ; Statistical
Ofﬁce of the European Communities 2014 ). Similarly to Sheldon and Kasser’s 1998 study,
ﬁnancial success was deﬁned here as ‘‘having a job that pays very well and having a lot ofnice possessions’’. In Poland, young adults with only average salaries effectively lack the wherewithal to
take out a more considerable bank loan or mortgage, also being often unable to pay fortheir education and cover the costs of improving their professional qualiﬁcations. There-fore, it seems that only by achieving ﬁnancial success, understood as ﬁnding a well-paidjob and earning an above-average salary, are young Poles able to attain a sense of securityand ﬁnancial independence. Why, then, did ﬁnancial success prove to be a signiﬁcant
predictor of meaning in life only for men? Again, this may at least in part be explained
when placed in a broader cultural context."

The analyses found that religiosity, defined in terms of Allport’s classic typology of Intrinsic and Extrinsic Orientations, was positively related to three important aspects of daily social life: how enjoyable people found their time with others, how confi-dent and self–assured they felt when they were with other people, and how much contact they had with the opposite sex. Intrinsic Orientation and External Social Orientation were positively related to how enjoyable people found their social inter -
actions to be, and Personal Extrinsic Orientation was positively related to enjoy -
ment of interactions and to how confident and self-assured people felt. External 
Social Orientation was also negatively related to amount of opposite-sex contact. In addition, the extent to which people held orthodox Christian beliefs was positively related to how enjoyable their interactions were and to the amount of same-sex con-tact they had each day. When evaluating these results, it is important to keep in mind that the social 
milieu in which the study was conducted was primarily Christian. Although the university at which the study was conducted is not affiliated with a specific religious group (nor has it ever been), the majority of participants described 1 3Journal of Religion and Health 
themselves as Christian of some type (228 of 282). Moreover, the full sample 
average score on the Christian Orthodoxy scale was 6.87 (maximum score 9). There is an established body of research indicating that similarity leads to 
attraction (e.g., McPherson et  al. 2001), and the dominant explanation for this relationship is that attitudinal similarity is rewarding (e.g., Byrne and Nelson 1965). Individuals with higher scores on the CO  scale were probably more likely 
to interact with attitudinally similar others than individuals with lower scores on the CO scale, which would lead to more satisfying interactions. A connection between religiosity and social life is also suggested by the posi-
tive relationship between enjoyment and External Social Orientation (e.g., “I go to church mainly because I enjoy seeing people I know there”)."

However, they were also informed that the study was run in cooperation with a local university charity organization which was currently raising money to help children in need. Each participant was presented with a description of the cause in writing, i.e., they read about a child suffering from a kidney disease (in one of the three versions, as presented in the Supplementary Materials; the version did not matter). Participants were informed that if they decided to support 
the cause, their money would be given to the charity in full. They were also told that the fund-raiser was not part of the study and that donations were entirely voluntary so their decision to take part was entirely up to them. Nevertheless, all participants were asked to answer several questions, allegedly for evaluation purposes, even if they decided not to donate any money. The questionnaire aimed to measure the desire to help (Want), the expectancy that this desire would be satisfied (Expectancy) , and to assess their attitude 
towards money. Since we wanted the participants to believe this was not a part of a study, we kept the questionnaire short and asked one question per each variable: To what extent is it important for you to help the child?—To measure Want; In your opinion, are campaigns like this effective?—
To measure Expectancy; and I carefully think about each zloty spent—to measure their attitude towards money (each responded on a 1–7 scale). Participants answered the questions in their cubicles so 
that they could have some privacy and not feel pressured in any way. After answering the questions, they were asked to put the questionnaire, along with the amount (if any) they were willing to donate, in the envelope and leave it on the desk (as participants were paid in single zloty coins, they could leave any amount ranging from 1 to 20 PLN)."

What motivates helping? Many researchers consider the desire to help victims as 
one of the most prominent motive driving declared or actual help (Hofmann and Dillen 2012; Butts et al. 2019). Desire is usually defined as an affectively charged moti-vation toward a certain object, person, or activity, whose satisfaction is associated with pleasure or a relief from displeasure (see Kavanagh et al."
10-1007_s11031-020-09853-3.pdf,Fundraising,"In fact, in the meantime we did additional study with completely different procedure when we manipulate Want . Although this time the manip-
ulation worked, and we replicate the previous results, we decided not to include this study into the paper to keep this paper more concise. However, we included this study into the Supplementary Material (see Study 0). Second, we also think that running the study about helping in COVID-19 situation can heavily influence the results (e.g., the helping mindset might be currently more salient than before). Thus, the replication of the previous results using exact the same procedures wouldn’t be possible and the results wouldn’t be comparable with the previous studies as the social context has changed drastically. From a pragmatic standpoint, our results suggest ways 
of designing an effective charitable fundraising or crisis relief campaigns, that is, campaigns that increase the audi-ence’s willingness to donate to victims or bodies tasked with handling the crisis (e.g. COVID-19 pandemic). Our results suggest that the message should address the prospects of goal attainment if just evoking emotions with regards to the victim is not possible. Past studies have suggested that pre-senting the victim by means of a photo depicting the victim’s circumstances (e.g., a photo of a hungry child expressing sadness) or with a specific background story about him/her (e.g., the hungry child’s parents died when he was 1 year old) will increase the audience’s emotional reactions to the victim’s plight, thereby also increasing their willingness to donate. Indeed, workers of non-governmental charities do their best to make people want to help others. However, other studies have demonstrated that many different factors can influence Want itself, such as outgroup biases (Stürmer et al."
10-1007_s11031-020-09853-3.pdf,Fundraising,"2006), prejudices against some groups (Abrams et al. 2016), and the identifiability of the person in need (Lee and Feeley 2016). It is difficult to successfully address all of 
these factors in any single charitable campaign. We sug-gest that charitable actions could be more effective when their work focuses on enhancing Expectancy, especially if it is difficult to evoke a desire to help. As shown here, even when desire is low, helping behavior might still be possi -
ble when expectancy is high. Therefore, our recommenda-tion for NGO’s, or any other fundraising organization, will be to always bear in mind that, by increasing the level of expectancy of success, the potential for helping behavior is thereby increased among donating recipients. This could be achieved, for example, by assuring the recipients that the money donated will be adequately invested, and that they will eventually obtain detailed information about how their donation helped. Indeed, recent studies show that informing people about effectiveness of the help increases donations, that is, charities presented as more effective are supported more compared to those presented as less effective (Caviola et al. 2020).

Additionally, we argue that Expectancy  is also crucial for 
public policy makers. Schelling (1968) pointed out that one 
of the biggest obstacles in effective policy decision-making is the identified victim effect, i.e., peoples’ tendency to pref-erentially give to identified versus anonymous victims of misfortune."

possibilities for travelling to Western countries and for acquiring expertise in psychotherapy,
in gaining training or in inviting lecturers and trainers to workshops. However, in those difficulttimes some prominent psychiatrists and psychologists elaborated and organized several psy-chotherapy training programs for major psychotherapy approaches (e.g. psychoanalysis, hu-manistic therapy, systemic family therapy and community psychiatry, see [ 1–3]. The political
transformation in 1989 of Poland into a democracy and free market allowed psychotherapy toarise. Poland ’s entrance into the European Union in 2004 resulted in new possibilities. Today, the value of psychotherapy is being continuously acknowledged. It seems that the
profession of the psychotherapist has also gained significant popularity. In the last few yearsmany training programs have developed that are connected with a variety of psychotherapeuticapproaches whose members belong to many psychotherapeutic associations (see [ 4]). In 1991
and 1994, the two largest and earliest associations, i.e. the Polish Psychiatric Association andthe Polish Psychological Association, designed the criteria and requirements for certifyingpsychotherapists and supervisors."

The majority of respondents (96 %) declared thatthey changed theories depending on their patients ’needs. Due to the outdated status of previous research on psychotherapy in Poland, the small

We wanted to provide a detaileddescription of the characteristics and practices of therapists in Poland. Specifically, we wantedto provide answers as to (a) how Polish therapists were trained (education, training programs,training therapy, supervision, certificates), and (b) how they practice (approaches, forms oftreatment, work setting, patients). We believe that our study can be of interest to manyclinicians around the world because it is the first nationwide empirical study presenting thefield of psychotherapy in the sixth most populated country in the European Union.

For the purpose of the study we constructed a self-administered survey consisting of 40 itemscovering various aspects of therapists ’professional characteristics, educational background,
work experience, work setting, work roles, case load, training and specialization, theoreticalorientation, supervision and questions about demographic variables. Most of the items weredesigned as checklists.

erogeneous in terms of body image and resources and that the observed profiles of these psychological variables would be differently related to levels of life satisfaction within the group of psoriatic patients, while controlling for sociomedi-cal covariates. Moreover, we assumed that psoriatic patients would declare, on average, lower levels of life satisfaction and a more negative body image and would assess their psychosocial resources as worse compared to the healthy comparison group. We also hypothesized that participants from various profiles, extracted on the basis of their body image and resources, would declare different levels of life satisfaction compared with the healthy comparison group.

Participants and procedure
The sample was comprised of 355 adults with a medical diagnosis of psoriasis and 380 healthy adults (without any chronic illnesses) recruited from a non-clinical population. The psoriatic patients were recruited both from among patients hospitalized in two dermatology clinics in Poland, where they filled out traditional, paper-and-pencil ques-tionnaires, and from members of the Union of Associa-tions of Patients with Psoriasis in Poland, who filled out an online inventory distributed via social media. Specifi-cally, the online part of the study was conducted because of the possibility of reaching patients all over Poland; in our study we did not want to limit ourselves only to clinics in large cities. Working online allowed us to recruit peo-ple from small towns, as well as individuals who do not have an active disease at the moment and do not require hospitalization. Importantly, in order to be a member of the Union of Associations of Patients with Psoriasis in Poland the patient should submit a medically confirmed diagnosis of psoriasis. As far as the first mode of recruitment is concerned, 
105 of the participants with psoriasis were patients of the Dermatology Clinic at the Military Institute of Medicine in Warsaw or the Dermatology Clinic of the Provincial Integrated Hospital in Kielce. Specifically, out of 180 patients eligible for the study in these two clinics, 105 were recruited and agreed to filled out questionnaires (58%), 36 declined (20%), and 39 (22%) completed the inventories with a very high level of missing data, which precluded including them in the statistical analysis."

toward women independently of religious fundamentalism
and extrinsic religiosity (the latter is unrelated to tolerance ofviolence against women after other variables are considered,
similarly to political conservatism). Intrinsic religiosity is neg-
atively related to tolerance of violence against women. Gender
does not moderate the associations among Catholic collectivenarcissism, religious orientations and tolerance of violence
against women. This means that men and women tolerate
violence against women when they endorse Catholic collec-tive narcissism. In the next study, we compare the association
between national collective narcissism and sexism (benevo-
lent and hostile) and tolerance of domestic violence againstwomen to the association between national in-group satisfac-
tion with sexism among men and women. Study 3
In Study 3, we test Hypothesis 3 that only national collective
narcissism (but not national in-group satisfaction) is associat-
ed with hostile sexism and tolerance of violence against wom-
en. In addition, we test Hypothesis 4, that the positive associ-ation between national collective narcissism and benevolent
sexism may be stronger among women than among men, and
Hypothesis 5 that the association between national in-groupsatisfaction and benevolent sexism may be negative among
women but positive among men. Finally, we tested whether
the role of collective narcissism in explaining sexism is spe-cific and unique in comparison to individual narcissism. Method
Participants Data for Study 3 were collected by the Ariadna
Research Panel as a part of a weekly opinion poll. The
random-quota sample is nationally representative in terms ofage, gender, and place of residence. Participants in Studies 1

This research offers an important insight into the dynamics of chronic stereotype 
threat. It demonstrates intellectual helplessness as a novel mediator by which nega-tive stereotype activation may influence not only performance but also identification with the domain. This mechanism should be highly important for teachers and poli-cymakers as it can shape the interest and further motivation to pursuit education in STEM domains. As a recent analysis of PISA results demonstrated, these personal interests may have a stronger effect on engagement in STEM than equality policy,

Despite the aforementioned limitations, the present findings have important theoreti-
cal and practical implications. From the theoretical standpoint, they offer a mean-ingful insight into a novel mechanism of chronic stereotype threat through intellec-tual helplessness—a reliable explanation of lower identification with a domain. The inclusion of this mediational path may be also a valuable source of new hypoth-eses regarding the dynamics of accumulative changes in motivational and cognitive aspects of repeated experiences of stereotype threat. The proposed mechanism is important as well for teachers and policy makers as it 
can shape boys’ interest in and a further motivation to pursuit education in humani-ties and social sciences. Additionally, as language skills are highly correlated with mathematics and science, they show their relevance for success in STEM domains (Stoet and Geary 2015).

Abstract
The study investigated the relationship between math anxiety in parents and teach-ers and math anxiety and math achievement in first- to third-grade children. The results indicate that math anxiety in fathers (but not mothers and teachers) is associ-ated with math anxiety in first-grade children and third-grade girls. Math anxiety in mothers and teachers (but not fathers) explains the level of math achievement in third-grade children. The research results indicate the importance of adults in shap-ing pupils’ math anxiety and math achievement, but these relationships vary depend-ing on gender and the grade year. The obtained outcomes generally suggest that adults’ math anxiety is not a social source of children’s math anxiety, but it can be considered a source of low math achievement among children in the final grade of early school education.

1 Introduction
1.1  Predictors and development of math anxiety and achievement
Math skills are mentioned in the recommendations of the European Parliament and 
the Council of the European Union (962/EC/2006, 2006) as one of the key compe-tences in the process of lifelong learning. They are also considered a key area of STEM education (Gonzalez and Kuenzi 2012; Holmlund et al. 2018). Early school experiences in learning mathematics are very important for the future development of children’s skills in this area (Levine et  al. 2010). It is important to understand the factors that predict differences in the level of math achievement in elementary

10-1007_s11469-019-00193-z.pdf,Associat,"The remaining question, however, is why sho pping addicts place such great importance on
self-enhancement and choose a hedonistic lifesty le at the expense of social relations that could
possibly enhance their self-esteem in a healthy w ay through validation received from others. High extraversion, which is amo ng the most consistently found personality traits among shop-
ping addicts (Andreassen et al. 2013; Balabanis 2002;M i k o łajczak-Degrauwe et al. 2012;
Uzarska et al. 2019), is connected to strong social needs. Therefore, the possible explanation
for the negligence of relationships of compulsive buyers may include their low levels ofagreeableness, which is a feature directly associat ed with the quality of interpersonal relation-
ships, strategies in resolving conflicts, tendencie s to prosocial behavior, and well-being in general
(DeNeve and Cooper 1998; Graziano et al. 2007; Jensen-Campbell and Graziano 2001; Neyer
and Voigt 2004). Although, in some cases, compulsive buying was related to higher agreeable-
ness (Miko łajczak-Degrauwe et al. 2012; Mowen and Spears 1999), which could possibly
predispose to increased sensitivity to retail techniques (Miko łajczak-Degrauwe et al. 2012); most
of the research consistently sh ows the relationship of compulsive buying tendencies with low
agreeableness, low cooperativeness, and high hostility (Andreassen et al. 2013,2015; Balabanis
2002; Granero et al."

tinction between the experience of social isolation (socialloneliness) and emotional isolation (emotional loneliness),DiTommaso and Spinner ( 1993 ) noted that emotional loneli-
ness appeared to be comprised of two domains, that is, familyemotional loneliness and romantic emotional loneliness. Thelack of romantic partners or intimate relationships may be an
important perceived causal factor for one ’s present feelings of
loneliness (e.g., Rokach and Brock 1998 ). For example, mar-
ried individuals and individuals living with a significant otherreported less romantic loneliness than those who were not in
such relationships (Bernardon et al. 2011). DiTommaso andCurr PsycholSpinner ( 1993 ) revealed that being involved in a romantic
relationship was significantly related to lower levels of roman-
tic loneliness, but was only weakly linked to family and socialloneliness. Divorce or widowhood were found to be associat-
ed with an increased risk of feeling lonely, whereas not living
alone and having more social support turned out to lower therisk of being lonely (Stickley et al. 2015 ). Furthermore, sev-
eral studies conducted in Poland also provided consistent re-sults demonstrating that single young adults report greaterromantic loneliness than young adults in non-marital relation-
ships (e.g., Adamczyk 2015 ). In regard to gender differences in the domain of loneliness,
the results of past studies are not congruent. In other words,some prior studies revealed that men experienced greater lone-
liness than women (e.g., Dykstra and de Jong Gierveld 2004),
whereas other studies indicated no differences (Cramer and
Neyedley 1998) or women reporting greater loneliness (e.g.,
Jakobsson and Hallberg 2005). In other studies, male university
students had higher levels of r omantic loneliness, while there
were no significant gender diffe rences for either social or family
loneliness (DiTommaso et al."

international), duration of participation in sport, duration ofweekly physicaland mental training, and mental preparation
efficacy beliefs, i.e.,to what extent mental preparation helps
them achieve the best possible result during the competition intheir discipline (using a rating scale 0 –100%). Mental Training Using Sport Mental Training Questionnaire
(SMTQ) participants reported their mental training routines. This was a66-item inventory which yielded an overall mental
training score as well as scores for the 4 subscales offoundational skills, performance skills, personal development
skills, and mental techniques. Participants responded using a
5-point Likert scale (1 = Bstrongly disagree ^,5= Bstrongly
agree). ProcedureGiven the number of already existing assessment tools and
available theoretical propositions targeted salient mental skillsand techniques (Table 1), we explored their structures and
conceptualized our questionnaire on the basis of Vealey’ s
(2007) framework. Based on the source materials (e.g.,
quotes) available in qualitative studies (Gould et al."

from Study 2 and Study 3 were combined, totalling the number
of 835 participants. To compare differences between the high
and low-level, female and male athletes, ttests for independent
samples were performed on each of the five factors and the
overall score. For the purpose of criterion validity analyses,
the participants were grouped i nto the following categories:
Competition Level Among the participants, 252 high-level
and 427 low-level athletes were identified. In line with previ-ous research (Eton et al. 1998 ; Roberts et al. 2008), the high-
level athletes were defined as those who participated in theirsport at a national and international level, and low-level ath-letes were those who participated in their sport at a recreational
or club level. To ensure that each sport was represented equally
in each group, participants were matched for sport type acrossthe two groups. Where sports were not matched, the respective
data were deleted from the sample. This resulted in a sample of
326 sport-matched participants, 163 per group.Curr PsycholGender In the sample, 368 female and 466 male athletes were
identified. To ensure that each gender was represented equally
in each group, participants were matched for sport type and
competition level across the male and female groups. Wherecompetition level and sport discipline were not matched, the
respective data were deleted from the sample."

sonality correlates for behavioral criteria at each level of hier-archy. The content of Tables 3and4enables a comparison of
the strength of relationship between personality and the fre-quency of behavior at different levels of their hierarchies, aswell as the comparison in terms of the relationship with be-
havioral criteria of values and traits, and between the FFM and
HEXACO model of personality traits. Hypothesis Verification
Behavioral Criteria Correlate with Multiple Measures
of Personality
The criteria we used were self-reported frequencies of behav-
ioral acts and based on them the components and factors, not a
priori related to a certain personality trait or value; so, weexpected that each of them should correlate with several dif-
ferent personality dispositions (traits and values). This hypoth-
esis was supported at each level in the hierarchical structure ofbehavior, including single behavioral acts. Let ’sc o n s i d e rj u s t

correlated with Beta (metatrait, HEXACO, r=. 3 2 ) ,
Hedonism (value, PVQ, r= .31), Fearfulness (facet,
HEXACO, r=−.29), Openness to Change (higher-order val-
ue, PVQ, r= .28), Honesty-Humility (basic trait, HEXACO, r
=−.27), Unconventionality (facet, HEXACO, r=. 2 7 ) ,
Stimulation (value, PVQ, r= .26), Modesty (facet,
HEXACO, r=−.26), Social Boldness (facet, HEXACO,
r= .25), and Conservation (higher-order value, PVQ, r=

10-1007_s12144-018-9892-9.pdf,Club,"For instance, read-ing a book and purchasing a musical album correlated more
highly with a basic trait (Openness) than with any facet. Also, the comparison of average correlations between per-
sonality constructs and the frequency of behaviors indicatedthat broad personality measures are comparable as predictors
of behavior to narrow personality variables. Similar resultswere obtained by Grucza and Goldberg ( 2007 ), who did not
find meaningful differences between broad and narrow per-sonality traits in their relationships with the frequency of ag-gregated behaviors. What is worth noting is that the highest level of personality
hierarchy included in Grucza and Goldberg ’s(2007 ) study
was the level of basic traits. In our study, we also included
personality metatraits, and it turned out that even constructs as
broad as metatraits were sometimes more highly correlatedwith specific behavioral criteria than narrow personality vari-
ables. For instance, behaviors such as drinking in a bar or
night club might be explained by the combination of narrow
personality traits and personal values (e.g., Hedonism,
Stimulation, Social Boldness etc. ; see Section BBehavioral
Criteria Correlate with Multiple Measures of Personality ^),
but it turned out that the highest correlate of the frequencyof this act was the Beta/Plasticity (or Dynamism) metatrait.We interpret this finding as an evidence that broad personality
constructs (metatraits and higher-order values), which express
or at least describe the shared variance of narrower personalityconstructs, on one hand, and some fundamental dimensions or
forces of personality, on the other (cf. DeYoung 2006 ;

creating a stable relationship, starting a family. Consecutive
steps in this second process lead to an increase in emotionaland social competences, enabling the individual to build close

procedures: due to the binary nature of the dependentvariable, the first method of choice is LR analysis,
9which
allows determination of the variables significantlyexplaining the variability of the dependent variable, andsubsequently, CART analysis, which enables optimization
of the cut-off points for the independent variables into
binary sets, maximizing the degree of explanation by agiven independent variable of the degree of variability
of the dependent variable (Knable et al. 2002;L ia n d
Rapkin 2009 ). This method is used mainly in economic
studies concerning purchase decisions, and recently inmedical studies, for determination of the risk/probability
of the ocurrence of specified behaviours, e.g., aggression
or risky behaviours (Liu et al. 2011) and diseases (Segal
1995;C o l o m b e te ta l . 2000 ), or other health-related be-
haviours (Lemon et al. 2003). The CART method also seems to be an adequate method
for tracing and an attempt to determine the variables associat-
ed with making the decision of registration in the bank of
potential bone marrow donors. The justification for the selection of the applied tech-
niques of analysis were: 1) lack of theoretical data enablingthe construction of a reliable model of the effect of the
investigated variables, subjected to verification. In such asituation, the exploration-predictive model occurred to be
the optimum choice, which is simultaneously a descriptive
model allowing the description and presentation of the pat-terns in the examined population group; 2) complementar-
ity of LR and CART –regression models focus on vari-
ables of a relatively high stat istical significance, whereas
decision trees do not optimize the adjustment of the modelto the data, but in a sequential way divide the examined
population into subgroups, based on the best prognosticvariable. This allows identification of subgroups in the
population predestined to th e ocurrence of a specified
event (Owczarek 2014 ). All statistical analyses were per-
formed using the software STATISTICA and SPSS.Results

Values Testing
Satisfying the iterative convergence criterion, parameters with
the highest reliability were determined (Table 2). Based on the characteristics of the logistic regression equa-
tion, information was obtained concerning the level of theexplained variance of the dependent variable of decision about
registration as PBMD; the strength of the relationship was also
determined between the selected set of predictive variables.Based on the value of the Wald test on the level of significance
p = .05, it may be presumed that the decision about registra-
tion as PBMD significantly depended on: satisfactory familyaffection ( p= .008); frequency of philanthropic and charitable
behaviours (p = .04) and conscientiousness ( p= .05)."

the examined Ukrainian sample.Curr PsycholConclusions
This research was motivated by reports of increasing migra-
tion of Ukrainian students into Polish universities in the last
few years. According to the Report of Foreign Students in
Poland in 2017 (published on www.studyinpoland.pl ), in the
years 2016 –2017, a total of 35,584 students from the Ukraine
studied in Poland. Research on personality traits and social
orientations such as individualism and collectivism in twoseparate groups of students could help the formulation of
adequate educational demands and specification of profiles
for fields of study by the universities ’authorities. It would
also improve the adaptation process of foreign students to a
Polish academic environment and, later, the entry of young
Ukrainian people into the Polish labour market. It is worth mentioning that although Poland still incorpo-
rates western standards of living after regaining autonomy and
joining the European Union, Ukraine is also undergoing socialand political changes that lead to transformations in social
orientations of its citizens and in the quality of their lives. This research conducted with Polish and Ukrainian studentsis the first stage of a long-term project aimed at investigating
the determinants of quality of life among Polish and Ukrainian
students, the underpinnings of social adjustment of Ukrainian
students in Poland, and mutual adaptation of Polish and
Ukrainian students studying together at Polish universities.Future research will examine other variables such as ethnic
identity, social axioms, and personal values. Compliance with Ethical Standards

Addiction
The results showed that SNS addiction was strongly associat-
ed with Facebook addiction and that this relationship wasstronger in the group of Facebook-only users than in the group
of multisite-social networkers (H2 supported). These results
support good convergent and discriminant validity of theBSMAS (H1 supported), and suggest that SNS addiction is
completely equivalent to Facebook addiction among
Facebook-only users (as Facebook is the only SNS these in-dividuals use) alas not completely equivalent to Facebook
addiction among multisite-social networkers (as Facebook is
not the only SNS these individuals use). Therefore, the results
support the notion that SNS addiction and Facebook addiction
refer to the same underlying addictive process to social net-working with somewhat different manifestations which could
reflect level of addiction, stage of addiction or subtype of
addiction. The construct of SNS addiction seems valid whenresearchers are interested in general aspects of SNS-function-
ing, which are relevant for all individuals addicted to SNSs. However, assessment of addiction to a specific SNS (e.g.Facebook) should be conducted when researchers are interest-
ed in unique aspects of functioning, which may differ betweenindividuals addicted to specific SNSs (Andreassen and
Pallesen 2013 ; Ryan et al. 2014 ; see also Throuvala et al."

Facebook addiction may be assumed to produce similar results,indicating the presence of generic antecedents and conse-

be limited to the present study ’s variables and sample. SNS Addiction, Facebook Addiction, Perceived Stress,

tion to the impaired functioning of individuals."

Introduction
Research on fertility and reproductive decisions indicates that
the age of first pregnancy and the birth of the first child is
steadily increasing in highly-developed countries (Australian
Bureau of Statistics 2012 ;G r a h a me ta l . 2015 ;S l e e b o s 2003 ;
Thévenon 2010 ;V u j čićet al. 2017 ). This trend is also visible
in Poland, where demographers have been warning about a
decline in birthrate since the early nineties (Centrum BadaniaOpinii Spo łecznych - Public Opinion Research Centre ,
CBOS); this fall is seen as the main cause of the decreasing
population of the country (CBOS 2010 ). Forecasts by the
Polish Central Statistical Office ( 2008 ) for the years 2008 –
2035 suggest that the population in Poland will decline at an
increasing pace. The fertility rate in Poland is currently only1.3, which is one of the lowest in both the European Union
and the world (Central Statistical Office 2017 ). In Poland, the mean age of a mother at the birth of her first
child rose from 27.4 years in 2014 to 27.8 in 2016 (Central
Statistical Office 2017 ). Three studies on the reproductive
decisions of Polish citizens carried out in the last seven yearshave shown that, despite the social and economic changes that
occurred in Poland during this period, neither the percentage
of women planning to have their first or subsequent child northe determinants of reproduction, changed significantly over
this time (CBOS 2010 ,2013 ,2017 ). Reproductive plans and decisions are influenced by the age
of the respondents, the presence of an existing child, and the
civil status of the partner (CBOS 2010 ,2013 ). The most com-
mon reasons given for postponing or resigning from parent-hood include difficulties in reconciling family and profession-
al roles, lack of an appropriate partner, fear of losing a job, and
valuing a career higher than parenthood. Highly-educatedwomen are less likely to declare a willingness to have children
(CBOS 2010 )."

ries are most commonly caused indirectly, during the so calleddash-board injuries, when the dash board strikes patient ’sb e n t

psychological support and counseling should be implemented
as part of the standard care to a patient suffering from such a
long-term complication like a fracture non-union. Kornfield,Lenze, and Rawson ( 2017 ) found that higher levels of depres-

of PTSD symptoms 12 weeks after surgery of hip fracture.Muscatelli et al. ( 2017 ) found that 33% of patients suffered

gery, this study investigated (1) the cultivation hypothesis,
assuming that the relationshi p between self-efficacy and
quality-of-life indices would be mediated by social support
received from medical personnel, family, and friends, and
(2) the enabling hypothesis, assuming that the association be-tween received social support and quality-of-life indices
would be mediated by self-efficacy. Method Patients with the first onset of non-small-cell lung
cancer ( N= 102) filled in questionnaires at 3 –4 days after
segmentectomy or lobectomy (time 1), at 1-month follow-up
(time 2), and at 4-month follow-up (time 3).Results Mediation analyses accounting for the effects of
age, gender, marital status (all measured at time 1), andthe mediator (measured at time 1 and time 2) yielded no
support for the cultivation hypothesis. Indirect effects were
observed for 0 out of 14 quality-of-life indices, measuredat time 3. In contrast, the enabling hypothesis was con-
firmed for 11 out of 14 quality-of-life indices (physical,
functional, cognitive, social, and emotional aspects; mea-sured at time 3). Conclusions Interventions for patients with lung cancer
may focus on enhancing social support receipt within the
first week after surgery, followed by a self-efficacy prompt3 weeks later. Keywords Non-small-cell lung cancer .Self-efficacy .Social
support .Quality of life .Enabling .Cultivation
Lung cancer is accounting for the largest number of cancer-
related deaths in the European Union [ 1], and it is causing
functional limitations more frequently than several other types
of cancer [ 2]. As the length of survival increases among pa-
tients with early stages of most frequent forms of lung cancer(i.e., non-small-cell lung cancer), attention toward maintain-ing an adequate quality of life is of great importance [ 3]. Consequently, across the last decade, quality of life becamethe main secondary outcome of any treatment for patients with
non-small-cell lung cancer, whereas survival rates represent
the primary outcome [ 4]. Identifying modifiable psychosocial factors, enhancing
quality of life is essential for developing effective interven-tions, facilitating post-surgery adjustment among lung cancerpatients [ 5]. Social support and self-efficacy are among the
prime candidates, as their effects on health indicators arebased on solid theoretical and empirical foundations [ 5–7]. *Aleksandra Luszczynska

to harm oneself may be a consequence of a crisis, accompanied by in-

punishment and attempts to avoid rejection. This tension leads to a cri-

psychotic symptoms ( Gunderson, 2011 ). Despite the fact that causes of
crises vary among individuals, common factors may be distinguished.There is usually a precipitated event that causes distress, acute anxiety
and a reduction in problem-solving capacity. A person in crisis is also
more likely to undertake help-seeking behavior ( Borschmann et al.,

spoke video game designed speci ﬁcally for youth in the Caribbean,
making it the ﬁrst IPV prevention tool of its kind in the region. Fur-
thermore, addressing themes such as gender inequality, intergenera-tional abuse, alcohol abuse as a contributing factor, the impact of IPVand the positive roles males can play in addressing male-perpetrated
violence, game content provides opportunities for increasing knowl-
edge and non-adversarial con ﬂict resolution skills that may be more
widely bene ﬁcial. Whilst these facets of the game were not evaluated in
the current study, the persuasive game strategy has potential not onlyas a young person-centred approach to building empathy, but also in
raising awareness about the multi-faceted nature of IPV and the con-
texts in which it emerges. The game has been recommended for inclusion in the national
school curricula in Barbados and Grenada and has been utilised as an
awareness-raising and empowerment intervention for girls in a
Caribbean Juvenile Detention Centre. There is also an on-going im-
plementation of Jesse in schools in Saint Lucia undertaken by educators
in the country with the assistance of researchers from the Ni3 ResearchCentre. Given the success of Jesse, the Ni3 Research Centre, supported
by funding from the UK Research and Innovation - Global ChallengesResearch Fund (GCRF), is currently developing culture-sensitive pro-
social video games for di ﬀerent world regions to address some of the
most prevalent and detrimental expressions of GBV (such as childmarriage and child sexual exploitation). 4.4. Conclusion
In sum, using a randomised controlled trial conducted in naturalistic
settings, the current study tested the e ﬀectiveness of a prosocial video
game, Jesse, in changing Barbadian youth's a ﬀective and cognitive re-
sponsiveness towards victims of IPV. The ﬁndings indicate that youth in
the
experimental condition, but not youth in the control condition,
scored higher on a ﬀective responsiveness towards victims of IPV after
the intervention and this change was sustained in a one-week follow-up. Contrary to our initial prediction, game exposure did not a ﬀect parti-
cipants' cognitive responsiveness towards IPV victims, pointing to dif-ferential formation processes of cognitive and a ﬀective responsiveness
among youth. Conﬂicts of interest

8measure. For instance, findings from the present study showed that 
young people from the USA are more likely to send and post own sexts 
than participants from other countries, while previous studies reported 
higher prevalence of sexting among Italian participants (Klettke et al., 
2014 ; Morelli et al., 2016a ). Meanwhile, Irish youth reported more risky sexting (i.e., sexting 
under substance use and sexting with strangers met online) than 
American youth, but this result could be due to the fact that the Irish 
sample was predominantly composed of boys, who are more likely to 
engage in risky sexual behaviors than girls (Bongers, Koot, Van der Ende, 
& Verhulst, 2003 ; Romer & Hennessy, 2007 ). Young Ugandans reported 
more non-consensual sexting than American youth, a result that aligns 
with widespread risky sexual behavior in Africa (Pinchoff, Boyer, 
Mutombo, Chowdhuri, & Ngo, 2017 ), which is leading to the imple -
mentation of sex education programs in schools, especially in Uganda 
(Kemigisha et al., 2019 ). Finally, Turkish and Czech youth, as compared 
to American youth, reported receiving more pressure from peers and 
partners to send sexts. This suggests that coercive and aggressive dy-
namics within dating partners may be more common and/or socially 
acceptable in these countries (Pik�alkov �a, 2012 ; Terzioglu et al., 2018 ; 
Toplu-Demirtas ¸, Hatipo �glu-Sümer, & Murray, 2018 ). Regarding socio-demographic variables, findings aligned well with 
previous research. Specifically, boys were more likely to be involved in 
risky and aggravated sexting than girls, in line with previous studies on 
biological sex differences in sexting (Gregg, Somers, Pernice, Hillman, & 
Kernsmith, 2018 ) and risky sexual behaviors (Romer & Hennessy, 
2007 ). Experimental sexting and risky sexting increased with age."

chestjournal.org 249Impairment of lung function during adolescence is an
early indicator of a variety of cardiorespiratory
conditions in later life.1Thus, it is essential to identify
potential hazards, particularly those that exist in daily
life, that may reduce the lung function of children. Some
environmental factors have been associated with lung
health, among which the impacts of long-term air
pollution exposure are of worldwide research interest.2
For example, for children in China, the ORs of FVCpredicted <85% ranged between 1.05 and 1.57 per
interquartile range increase in the 4-year averageconcentrations of air pollutants. 3Similar adverse
associations between higher air pollution exposure and
lung function decline also have been reported in other
countries and regions.4,5
To reduce the adverse effects of air pollution, some
countries have established a variety of air qualityguidelines. However, in recent years, various published
studies have suggested that air pollution concentrations
below these thresholds, that is, low to moderate exposure,
still may impact lung health. In Switzerland and the
Netherlands, 1-year exposure to particulate matter with
diameters of <2.5
mm (PM 2.5), where the concentration
was only half of the European Union (EU) limits (25 mg/
m3), was associated with signi ﬁcant decrease in children ’s
lung function.6,7In Australia, pediatric FVC decreased by
–1.19% per interquartile range increase in nitrogen
dioxide (NO 2), where the annual concentration was one-
third of the national standard (30 parts per billion).8By

chestjournal.org 249Impairment of lung function during adolescence is an
early indicator of a variety of cardiorespiratory
conditions in later life.1Thus, it is essential to identify
potential hazards, particularly those that exist in daily
life, that may reduce the lung function of children. Some
environmental factors have been associated with lung
health, among which the impacts of long-term air
pollution exposure are of worldwide research interest.2
For example, for children in China, the ORs of FVCpredicted <85% ranged between 1.05 and 1.57 per
interquartile range increase in the 4-year averageconcentrations of air pollutants. 3Similar adverse
associations between higher air pollution exposure and
lung function decline also have been reported in other
countries and regions.4,5
To reduce the adverse effects of air pollution, some
countries have established a variety of air qualityguidelines. However, in recent years, various published
studies have suggested that air pollution concentrations
below these thresholds, that is, low to moderate exposure,
still may impact lung health. In Switzerland and the
Netherlands, 1-year exposure to particulate matter with
diameters of <2.5
mm (PM 2.5), where the concentration
was only half of the European Union (EU) limits (25 mg/
m3), was associated with signi ﬁcant decrease in children ’s
lung function.6,7In Australia, pediatric FVC decreased by
–1.19% per interquartile range increase in nitrogen
dioxide (NO 2), where the annual concentration was one-
third of the national standard (30 parts per billion).8By
contrast, no substantial impacts were observed in several
other low-polluted or moderately polluted countries.7
These inconsistent ﬁndings may be explained partly by
differences in population characteristics that may modify
the association. Being overweight or obese amon g adolescents is a rapidly
growing health concern. Increasing evidence shows that
being overweight or obese may strengthen the adverse
effects of air pollution on respiratory health.9-11In
addition, some research has shown that being
underweight, although less common in high-income
countries, also is associated with lung function decline.4,12
However, these studies either focused on the elderly
population or occurred in highly polluted areas. Limitedknowledge is available of the interaction effects between air
pollution and weight status on lung function for
adolescents in low-polluted to moderately polluted regions. The EU is one of the world ’sﬁrst economies to have air
pollution legislation, with the latest directive established
in 2008. 13Although most member countries haveTake-home Points

single largest environmental health hazard in the EU,
particularly for pediatric lung health.14In addition, one
in eight EU children is obese, which become a serious
public health challenge for this region.15To develop
next-generation strategies of air quality management
and health protection for children, it is necessary to
assess the interaction between long-term exposure to air
pollution at less than EU limits and abnormal weight on
adolescents ’lung function impairment.In this study, we investigated the modifying effect of
weight status on the association between air

employed and we expected that this would be acknowledged in at least the study abstract; this did not have to be the case with all
research. Secondly, only articles published in peer-reviewed journals were considered. Thus, it may be that the results are a ﬀected to
some extent by publication bias or the tendency of journals to publish work which reports signiﬁ cant results ( Perestelo-Pérez, 2013 ). Lastly, we only analyzed articles published in English; which could have resulted in having omitted some important studies among

master  concept  that  uniﬁes  much  of  what  is  going
on  in  world  politics  today”  [1,  p.  XV]. The  way  people  relate  to  their  ethnic  and  national  groups
seems  vital  for  understanding  political  tensions. Identity
dynamics  play  an  increasingly  important  role  in  shaping
world  politics. We  observe  rising  dissatisfaction  with
supranational  organisations  such  as  the  European  Union
or  United  Nations,  and  attempts  to  undermine  the  inter-
group  status  quo  in  the  Catalonian  or  Scottish  referenda. Political  leaders  pledge  strong  allegiance  to  protecting
their  national  groups  from  others. In  line  with
Fukuyama’s  [1]  insight,  one  way  to  understand  currentpolitics  is  to  shift  focus  from  political  ideologies,  under-
stood  as  socially  shared  systems  of  beliefs  about  desired
order  of  society  in  general  (e.g. [2]),  to  people’s  beliefs
about  their  national  and  ethnic  identities  in  particular. As  a  vivid  example,  US  President  Donald  Trump  rarely
refers  to  himself  as  a  conservative,  although  he  proudly
(and  unexpectedly  for  a  Western  politician)  declares
himself  a  nationalist. In  political  psychology,  nationalism
has  usually  been  conceptualised  as  ‘a  perception  of
national  superiority  and  an  orientation  toward  national
dominance’  [3,  p.  271]."

estimated  minimum  of  perhaps  5%. What  is  social  identity? Although  there  are  various  deﬁnitions  of  social  identity,
they  have  in  common  that  social  identities  consist  of  how
people  deﬁne  themselves  in  terms  of  the  groups  to  which
they  think  or  feel  they  belong. People  can  (and  typically
do)  have  multiple  identities,  for  example,  someone  may
think  of  herself  as  a  vegetarian,  a  carpenter,  and  a  mother. Social  identities  do  not  require  formal  acknowledgment
from  a  group. Although  there  may  be  a  carpenters’  union
that  issues  a  membership  card,  there  is  no  corresponding
credential  for  being  a  mother. Moreover,  the  salience  of
these  identities  can  (and  generally  will)  vary  across  time
and  situations. While  working,  our  exemplar  is  a  carpen-
ter,  whereas  at  home,  she  is  a  mother. Finally,  social
identities  include  normative  expectations  for  attitudes
and  behaviors. Carpenters  are  hard-working  and  precise,
whereas  mothers  are  loving  and  kind,  and  so  forth. Perhaps  the  most  signiﬁcant  body  of  work  on  social

finding showing that delusion -like experiences increase in individuals reporting both 
elevated BIB and reduced suppression of sadness may also mean that delusional beliefs 
require some cognitive resources to be developed and maintained. Hence, among 
individuals with high belief inflexibility who are characterized by reduced cognitive 
resources, delusions cannot be formed in conditions of sadness suppressio n, i.e. when 
cognitive overload increases. Consequently, reduction of cognitive capacity due to 
suppression may result in a decrease of delusions. What is more, it is likely that the effect 
of cognitive overload on psychotic symptoms is particularly pronou nced among 
individuals with lowered mood, since in case of depression cognitive resources are 
additionally captured by rumination, which has also been demonstrated to be increased by 
expressive suppression [50]. There are a number of limitations associat ed with the current research. Firstly, the 
cross -sectional design of the study precludes causal inferences. Secondly, although we 
used well -established self -report measures, it may be difficult to assess cognitive biases 
and emotion regulation strategies v ia introspection, therefore, the findings obtained in the 
study require further examination with more objective behavioural tools. What is more, 
the study sample was composed of university students, mostly women, therefore our 
findings cannot be directly g eneralized to the general population; further research should 
utilize a more balanced sample to obtain findings which could be more representative for 
the general population. In summary, the current study provided evidence to suggest that expressive 
supp ression of negative emotions may significantly, although differently, influence both 
hallucinatory and delusion -like experiences. The findings also showed that belief ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
inflexibility bias increases delusion -like experiences only among individuals with a 
lowe red tendency to suppress emotional expression (sadness in particular)."

Summing up, the main result of our study suggests the existence of a temporal segregation of ERP markers of conscious pro-
cessing, in line with previous reports and theoretical accounts ( Aru & Bachmann, 2017; Koivisto et al., 2017 ). Successful manip-
ulation of the level of processing in our study suggests that both early and late components of ERP response may represent neural
activity involved in representing conscious content. In this view, early components (VAN) mark the initial perceptual experience of a
stimulus and late components (LP) re ﬂect the conscious experience of abstract, non-perceptual information. Both may contribute to
the NCC-proper. Acknowledgments

recruitment could be most pronounced in peripheral parts of early
visual cortex of blind individuals, as peripheral areas are primary
receivers of auditory and, potentially, high-level information [ 15,

may, in turn, retain its typical preference for high-resolution spatial
processing, such as recognizing Braille characters or localizing
sound in space—tasks that are known to involve early visual cor-tex in both sighted and blind individuals [ 2,22–27 ]. In summary,
our results add to the growing body of evidence that early visual

2  M.  Makara-Studzi ´nska  et  al. Introduction
Lyme borreliosis  is  a  multisystem  inﬂammatory  anthropo-
zoonosis caused  by  a  complex  interaction  between  the
spirochete Borrelia  burgdorferi  sensu  lato  (B.  burgdorferi
s.l.) and the immune system  of  the  infected  individual  at
the site  of  infection.1
Annually,  more  than  25,000  new  cases  of  Lyme  dis-
ease are  diagnosed  in  the  USA  (incidence  7.9/100,000),
and around  85,000  in  Europe.2The  NIZP-PZH,  the  Polish
National Institute  of  Public  Health-National  Department
of Hygiene,  reports  that  the  incidence  of  B.  burgdor-
feri infection  in  Poland  increased  by  almost  50%  in  the
period 2011- - -2014.3Although  in  Poland,  the  incidence  varies
according to  province,  it  was  found  to  be  39.7/100,000  for
the whole  of  Lublin  province  in  2014.4
The  epidemiology  of  tick-born  disease  depends  on  a  num-
ber of factors,  including  the  speciﬁcity  of  natural  resources
and type of  employment  in  the  region,  with  Eastern  Poland
being one of the more  exposed  regions  in  the  European
Union.4
The symptomatology of the B.  burgorferi  sensu  lato  com-
plex varies according to the  species  of  Borrelia  present. Eighteen species have been diagnosed,  with  individual  types
characterized by different tissular afﬁnity: i.e. neural  sys-
tem or dermal, generalized or particular; a  high  level  of
pathogenicity  has been found in three  species.5All  types
can cause the occurrence of a primary  lesion  known  as  ery-
thema  migrans. A diagnosis of  borreliosis  must  take  into
account  the  epidemiological  aspect,  the  tick  bite,  the  clin-
ical aspect  and  the  serological  aspect,  with  a  two-step
diagnostic procedure  based  on  an  immune  enzymatic  test
and Western  blotting.6The  disease  is  characterized  by  a
multiorgan symptomatology  and  differentiated  clinical  pic-
ture, which  can  be  attributed  to,  among  other  things,  its
considerable adaptability  to  the  human  organism.5
Asbrinkn  and  Hovmark7deﬁne  three  clinical  pictures  of
infection: early  local  type,  early  disseminated  type  and  late
type. The  early  local  type  is  present  in  half  the  patients
as erythema  migrans  between  three  and  30  days  following
infection. The  early  disseminated  type  can  develop  several
days or  months  following  the  bite:  some  symptoms  from  cen-
tral nervous  system  can  appear ,  sometimes  without  signs
of erythema  migrans ."

 reason, in selected cases with locally advanced tum ors, denosumab alone might be 
preferred to denosumab combined with curettage. There are also several patients, who are definitive ly inoperable and will stay on 
denosumab therapy probably life-long. Although the tolerance of treatment was 
excellent, the data on the long-term use of denosum ab for metastatic/unresectable 
GCTB are still limited [22,24]. The reduction of th e frequency of administrations in 
patients who have achieved long-term stable disease  on denosumab deserves 
further investigations and is subject to an Europea n Organisation for Research and 
Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) study in development. Conclusions 
To summarize, denosumab therapy in GCTB is associat ed with a high rate of tumor 
control with excellent profile. Denosumab today is the gold standard medical 
treatment in the unresectable locally advanced or m etastatic disease. Data suggest 
that neoadjuvant therapy with denosumab may become the option for treatment of 
initially locally advanced, high-risk tumors to fac ilitate surgical resection or avoid 
mutilating surgery. In cases in which we  expect to  perform an en-bloc surgery in a 
locally advanced GCTB denosumab is recommended preo peratively, but the risk of 
recurrences after curettage of GCTB following denos umab therapy in these high risk 
tumors raises the question about the optimal durati on of preoperative treatment, 
about the indication of denosumab when intralesiona l surgical treatment is planned 
approach, and it implies a careful selection of can didates to neoadjuvant denosumab 
and type of surgery planning in a multidisciplinary  fashion. These questions should be MANUSCRIPT

10-1016_j-ejtd-2019-100131.pdf,Associat,"According  to  Hurlemann  et  al. (2007) ,  episodic  memory  problems  in  BPD  can  be  caused  by  the
interference  of  emotional  hyperarousal. Memory  problems  may
also  be  associated  with  impulsive  actions  or  behaviour,  which
evokes  shame,  regret,  guilt  or  fear  of  punishment  (Boon  &  Draijer,
1993 ). For  this  reason,  people  with  possession-form  presentations
should  receive  in-depth  clinical  evaluation  to  avoid  false-positive
diagnoses,  based  on  superﬁcial  features. There  seems  to  be  a  thin  line  between  malignant  and  non-
malignant  possession. Anthropological  literature  differentiates
between  ‘central  possession’,  including  mediumship  and  associat-
ed  with  positive  (sometimes  ritually-induced)  experiences,  and
‘peripheral  possession’–malignant  forms  believed  to  be  stress-
induced  afﬂictions  (Boddy,  1994 ). Psychiatric  manuals  such  as  the
DSM  and  ICD  obviously  concentrate  on  the  latter  forms  only. For
instance,  ICD-10  criterion  C  for  trance  and  possession  disorders
says  that  these  episodes:  ‘‘must  be  unwanted  and  troublesome,
occurring  outside,  or  being  a  prolongation  of,  similar  states  in
religious  or  other  culturally  accepted  situations’’  (WHO,  1993 ,
p.  103). Examples  of  a  religious  or  culturally  accepted  situation
mentioned  in  ICD-10  are  Cavadee,  deliverance  ministry,  faith-
healing  sessions,  and  exorcisms. Their  participants  are  likely  to
react  adequately  to  the  context  and  scripts  they  have  learnt  during
socialisation  so,  because  it  is  expected  to  perform  certain
movements  or  utter  speciﬁc  sounds  during  Cavadee  or  exorcism,
people  may  simply  do  so,  even  though  they  are  not  necessarily
aware  that  this  is  learned  behaviour  (Pietkiewicz,  2008 ). On  the
other  hand,  in  some  trauma  survivors  similar  actions  may  be
performed  by  a  dissociative  part  of  their  personality  which
temporarily  takes  control,  for  which  the  dissociative  part
functioning  in  daily  life  may  have  amnesia."

Objectives: To investigate if air pollution and greenness exposure from birth till adulthood affects adult asthma, 
rhinitis and lung function. Methods: We analysed data from 3428 participants (mean age 28) in the RHINESSA 
study in Norway and Sweden. Individual mean annual residential exposures to nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), partic -
ulate matter (PM 10 and PM2.5), black carbon (BC), ozone (O3) and greenness (normalized difference vegetation 
index (NDVI)) were averaged across susceptibility windows (0–10 years, 10–18 years, lifetime, adulthood (year 
before study participation)) and analysed in relation to physician diagnosed asthma (ever/allergic/non-allergic), 
asthma attack last 12 months, current rhinitis and low lung function (lower limit of normal (LLN), z-scores of 
forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1), forced vital capacity (FVC) and FEV 1/FVC below 1.64). We 
performed logistic regression for asthma attack, rhinitis and LLN lung function (clustered with family and study 
centre), and conditional logistic regression with a matched case-control design for ever/allergic/non-allergic

53.Results 
3.1. Study population 
The majority (58%) of participants were female with a median age 
for the total study population of 28.4 years, ranging from 18 to 40 years. All participants were born between 1975 and 1997 (Table 1). 3.2. Air pollution 
None of the mean air pollution exposure values exceeded the limit 
values of the European Union (EU) (Table S6), while PM2.5 surpassed the 
WHO guidelines values in all centers and PM10 exceeded the WHO 
guideline in two of the centers (Uppsala and Gothenburg). Mean 
greenness exposure values ranged between 0.5 and 0.6 across centres 
and time windows (Table S7). NO2, PM2.5, PM10 and BC were highly 
correlated with each other, with coefficients ranging from 0.603 to 
0.917 (Table S4a-S4c). 3.3. Ever asthma, allergic and non-allergic asthma 
NO2 was a risk factor for ever asthma and allergic asthma before (OR 
1.01 (1.00 –1.03) and 1.02 (1.00 –1.04), respectively) but not after 
adjustment for confounders (OR 1.00 (0.98 –1.02) and 1.02 (0.99 –1.05), respectively, Table 2). BC was a risk factor for ever asthma in univariable 
analysis (OR 1.03 (1.00 –1.07)) but was a protective factor for non- 
allergic asthma after adjustment (OR 0.92 (0.85 –1.00))."
10-1016_j-envint-2020-106219.pdf,Union,"Since the focus in our paper was to investigate 
effects of air pollution and greenness on health outcomes, and not on 
determining prevalence of diseases in a population, it is likely that the 
internal validity of our results are not compromised. 5.Conclusion 
In conclusion, this study found that air pollution exposures 
throughout the lifespan increased the risk for asthma attacks, rhinitis 
and low lung function in adulthood, but not for physician-diagnosed 
asthma. Greenness was not associated with asthma attacks, rhinitis or 
asthma diagnosis, but it was a risk factor for FEV 1 and FVC below lower 
limit of normal. Our results confirm that recent air pollution exposures 
are associated with lung health outcomes, but suggest that also air 
pollution exposures as far back in time as childhood and adolescence 
increase the risk of poor lung health in adulthood. Funding

The short -term ozone data were derived from UBA as well. The concentrations were obta ined 
from a background monitoring site (www.env -it.de/stationen/public/station.do) in Munich 
which is approximately 9 km northeast of city center (Johanneskirchen) and a site which is 
approximately 2 km northeast the center of Wesel (Feldmark)  (Fuertes et al., 2015) . For ozone, according to its high within - and across -day variability, as well as recommendation 
from the UBA (https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en/topics/air/ozone), we calculated 
concentration (µg/m³) of moving 8 -hour average for every hour (7 hour before and  of the hour 
of interest) and thereby identified a maximum of 8 -hour average for every day. The maximum 
of the daily maximum 8 -hour average concentration was selected over 0 (same day), and 1, 2, 
3, and 7 days prior to the depressive symptoms assessment (l ags 0 to 7 days). Since all of the 
published prior studies that reported the significant short -term ozone effects may detect the 
associations within 7 days  (reviewed by Zhao et al., 2018) , our selected time frames enabled 
us to detect the possible associat ion between short -term ozone and depressive symptoms. For NO 2 and PM 10, we utilized average of the daily concentrations (µg/m³) of 0 (same day), 
and 1, 2, 3, and 7 days prior to the day that depressive symptoms were evaluated for our 
analysis (lags 0 to 7 days, same time frames as in the case of ozone). 2.3. Depressive symptoms  
Depressive symptoms were assessed by Depression Screener for Teenagers (DesTeen). DesTeen is a specific validated tool for screening of adolescent depression in Germany. It 
contains 14  items on four -point scale that focus on cognitive and emotional symptoms for 
assessing the depressive symptoms over the preceding two weeks (Allgaier et al., 2014; 
Pietsch et al., 2011) ."

currently known about the speci ﬁc factors reinforcing health-
promoting behaviors among nursing home residents. Research exploring the issue of health-related behavior of institu-
tionalized older adults is extremely important, as its ﬁndings can
offer an insight into the speci ﬁcity, determinants and multifaceted
consequences of such behaviors. One such consequence, obesity, is
increasing among such residents, with consequent effects on the
services needed, equipment and facilities provided, and eventual
morbidity.22Although many studies have examined various aspects
of the physical and mental health of older institutionalized adults, as
well as their quality of life,1,3,17few have performed more complex
evaluations of health-related behavior in a nursing home setting. Their results indicate that nursing home residents do engage in vari-
ous health-promoting behaviors related to wellbeing, health status
and personal attributes.35,42 ,41,55Spirituality in late-life functioning
Spirituality appears to be an important predictor of late-life
functioning and may be of special value in dealing with the chal-
lenges of later life.36,65As a psychological term, spirituality can be
understood as a multidimensional theoretical construct referring
to a speci ﬁc domain of human activity. Its essence is transcendence
beyond the experience of self, which can take place both within
the person, as self-realization or personal development, and out-
side cf.43
Extensive empirical evidence indicates that spirituality has a strong
positive in ﬂuence on mental and physical health.28,29,37It can promote
personal growth after trauma44and increase satisfaction with life in
various groups.2,4,18Its in ﬂuence on health status and wellbeing has
also been examined in groups of elders.40,52,62,66The importance of
spirituality is particularly apparent among older residents of long-
term care institutions, who are often characterized by disability and
greater dependence on others.20,51
Much less is known about the role of spirituality for health behav-
iors. Personal resources such as spirituality can have a considerable
inﬂuence on health, and it has been proposed that it may achieve this
by acting through health behavior.25Studies suggest that spirituality
may affect health-promoting behaviors in pregnant women,10as well
as dietary habits and alcohol consumption.5,14Spirituality can also
promote a healthy lifestyle in groups of older adults: a study of stu-
dents of the Third Age University and members of the Rosary union, a
religious practice, found that the healthy lifestyle was affected more
by spirituality as a personal resource than the level of religious prac-
tice.44However, to date, no research exists regarding the in ﬂuence of
spirituality on the health-related behavior of seniors resident in
long-term care institutions. E-mail address: magdalena.zadworna@uni.lodz.pl

Satisfaction with life as factor predicting health behavior
The sense of satisfaction with life, treated as a measure of the
quality of life, is one of the human health resources within the psy-
chosocial dimension. As Diener, Pressman, Hunter, and Delgadillo /C0
Chase16state, people high in subjective wellbeing often engage in
healthier behaviors, and this mediational pathway may be a key
cause of greater health and longevity. There is substantial evidence that behaviors such as smoking, lack
of physical exercise, and heavy alcohol consumption are associated
with stress and negative mood states like depression, distress and anx-
iety.31,38However, the relationship between prudent health behaviors
and positive well-being is less well established. Grant, Wardle and
Steptoe21propose that the association between satisfaction with life
and health-promoting behavior is likely to be bidirectional, but may
partly account for the relationship between positive states and good
health. Similar associations between satisfaction with life and physical
activity, not smoking and moderate alcohol consumption have been
documented elsewhere.53,63
Although only few studies on health behaviors have addressed
older adults, especially those resident in institutions, psychological
well-being was found to predict physical activity level over the
course of 11 years among a nationally representative sample of older
people in the United Kingdom.32Satisfaction with life was associated
with reductions in rates of obesity, smoking, heavy alcohol consump-
tion and inactivity among community-dwelling adults.60High-
satisfaction individuals used more preventative health services and
thus had fewer doctor visits overall.33
Several potential mechanisms have been posited to account for
associations between positive emotional states or personal resources,
and lower morbidity and mortality; these include improved health-
related behavior, direct physiological bene ﬁts, and enhanced resistance
to stress.19,12However, the impact of spirituality and satisfaction with
life on a healthy lifestyle and the causal pathways between those
factors are not fully understood."

study ( Bruine de Bruin et al., 2007 ). First, for each participant we
calculated the number of negative outcomes they had experienced
given the con ﬁrmatory answer to a screening question (e.g., a negative
outcome of buying new clothes or shoes that were never worn wastaken into account if an individual answered that they bought new
clothes or shoes). Next, we computed the proportion of negative deci-
sion outcomes that were not avoided to all experienced decision out-
comes for each participant separately. Finally, this score was subtractedfrom 0, with higher values re ﬂecting a higher success in avoiding ne-
gative decision outcomes. 42.2.8. An index of recognition memory and vividness of decision outcomes
Participants were presented with ten target decision outcomes from
the original DOI task which were shown in the ﬁrst stage of the study
(e.g., “Lost more than PLN 1000 on a stock-market investment ”) and ten
distractor decision outcomes that were generated to closely resemble
the original outcomes (e.g., “Lost more than PLN 1000 on an invest-
ment fund ”). The outcomes were presented in a random order. The
participants' task was to indicate whether an ‘old’outcome had been
presented in the ﬁrst stage of the study or a ‘new ’outcome that had not
been presented before. As an index of recognition memory we calcu-
lated d' from signal detection theory. The d' index is estimated as the
diﬀerence between the inverse of the cumulative distribution function
of the normal distribution of hit rate (e.g., a participant indicated anoutcome presented before as an ‘old’outcome) and false-alarm rate
(e.g., a participant indicated an outcome not presented before as an‘old’outcome). The d' index is non-standardized."

services is on the agenda in the European Union. The E-COMPARED  consortium  
conducted a survey aimed at exploring stakeholders’ knowledge, acceptance and 
expectations of  digital  treatment s for depression, and at identify ing facto rs that might 
influence their opinions when considering  the implementation of these approaches. Method: An online survey was conducted in eight European countries:  France, 
Germany, Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and The United 
Kingdom . Organisations representing government bodies, care providers, service -
users, funding/insurance bodies, technical developers and researchers were invited 
to participate in the survey. The participating countries and organisations  reflect the 
diversity in healt h care infrastructures and e -health implementation across Europe. Results:  A total of 764 organisations were invited to the survey during the period

5. 1. Introduction  
Depression is currently a leading cause of years lived with disability (YLD) in 146 
countries (Vos et al., 2015) and Major Depressive Disorder is expected to become 
the greatest contributor to the global burden of disease (WHO, 2008)."
10-1016_j-invent-2017-01-001.pdf,Union,"As the standardized parts of treatment are delivered online it also 
means that sessions can be used to address and tailor  the treatment to individual ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

patient ’s needs. The standar dized components can be delivered online, which for the 
patient means unlimited access to treatment and less demands in terms of travel  and 
costs (Romijn et al., 2015) . It has been suggested that BT can be an alternative to 
ICBT ( the most common treatment for mild to moderate depression) , for example  in 
specialized treatment services and for patients with more severe symptomatology 
(Kleiboer et al., 2016) . Examples of BT designs that have been evaluated with 
promising result are unguided self -help reading m aterial combined with face -to-face 
sessions, and digital therapy as a partial replacement of face -to-face sessions (Ly et 
al., 2015; Wentzel et al., 2016) . In some countries like Australia, Canada and Sweden there are examples of 
ICBT programme s being transfer red from research settings into utilisation  within 
regular care services  (Hadjistavropoulos et al., 2014 ; Hedman et al., 2014; Titov et 
al., in press) . An integration of ICBT treatment into national health services is now on 
the agenda in t he European Union (Vis et al., 2015). This is reflected in several 
ongoing European research and funding programs ( E-COMPARED, Joint action and 
Wellbeing, Horizon 2020). Effectiveness -research to establish clinical and cost -
benefits of ICBT in  real world s ettings has been conducted (e.g. Hadjistavropoulos et 
al., 2014; Hedman et al., 2014; Ruward et a., 2012, Titov et al., in press ) and is 
currently researched in different European settings (Kemmeren., 2016; Kleiboer et 
al., 2016) . Therefore , it is of impor tance to assess the views of all stakeholders that 
would be directly involved or affected by the implementation of ICBT treatments such 
as government bodies, care providers, professionals, patients and funders. Limited

41.8% to 51.2% at the age of 15-16 years (in the LI SA/GINI North and LISA/GINI South 315 
cohorts, respectively), as shown in Table E7 in the  Online Repository. 316 
Cohort-specific and combined overall associations o f air pollution exposure at birth and at the 317 
time of biosampling and IgE sensitization to mixes of common inhalant and/or food allergen 318 
extracts up to 15-16 years are shown in Fig 2 and F ig E2 in the Online Repository, 319 
respectively. The heterogeneity between cohort-spec ific effect estimates was generally 320 
moderate ( I2 = 0-72%). In general, no consistent evidence was fo und for either exposure at 321 
birth, or at the time of biosampling to be associat ed with sensitization to any common allergen 322 
up to 15–16 year of age. In the cohort-specific ana lyses, we observed statistically significant 323 
positive associations with several air pollutants i n the PIAMA cohort, but not in the other 324 
included cohorts. The combined adjusted meta-analys is odds ratios for air pollution exposure 325 
at birth ranged from OR=0.99; (95% confidence inter val: 0.83–1.17), for a 10 µg/m 3 increase 326 
in PM 10 exposure to 1.32 (0.95 – 1.84), for a 5 μg/m 3 increase in PM 2.5 exposure. Similar 327 
results were obtained in relation to air pollution exposure at the time of biosampling (Fig E2 328 
in the Online Repository). The results of the fully  adjusted analyses were largely comparable 329 
to those based on the basic model (Table E8 in the Online Repository). Further, increasing 330 
cut-offs for IgE positivity to any of the tested in halant and/or food allergen extracts (ie, ≥0.70 331 
kU A/L and ≥3.5 kU A/L) had no major impact on the overall results (Tab le E9 in the Online 332

seminal  model presented  by Greenwald  and Stiglitz  (1993) . The model originally  highlighted  the diffusion  of idiosyncratic  
shocks within banking  and commercial  networks,  leading  to aggregate  business  cycles. It has recently  been complemented  
to include  the concept  of bankruptcy  avalanches  (Delli Gatti et al., 2006), business  cycles (Delli Gatti et al., 2009), ﬁnan-

 claimed that the local environment was polluted, th ose who strongly identified with their 
region and with their nation, were more likely to d eny the pollution (Bonaiuto et al., 1996). These tendencies may eventually result in neglectin g environmental protection or even taking 
actions which are anti-environmental, and undermine  the well-being of the national in-group  
in the long run. In the research presented here, we aim to integrate  these findings with the current 
literature on various forms of in-group identificat ion and their different social functions. We 
differentiate in-group identification from collecti ve narcissism and predict that only the latter 
is positively associated with support for environme ntally harmful policies. 1.1 Inter- and intragroup consequences of different  forms of in-group identification 
 Previous research and theorizing have shown the ps ychological and social differences 
between more secure and more defensive forms of ide ntification with respect to different 
intergroup contexts (e.g., based on ethnic, nationa l or organizational criteria, e.g., Amiot & 
Aubin, 2013; Cichocka, 2016; Golec de Zavala, Cicho cka, Eidelson, & Jayawickreme, 2009; 
Kosterman & Feshbach, 1989; Roccas, Klar, & Liviata n, 2006; Schatz, Staub, & Lavine, 
1999). The defensive form of in-group identificati on can be operationalized as collective 
narcissism—an attitudinal orientation toward one’s in-group capturing individuals’ inflated 
beliefs in the greatness of their in-group combined  with a need for external recognition (Golec 
de Zavala, Cichocka, Eidelson, & Jayawickreme, 2009 )."

2growing population (Godfray et al., 2010 ). As IPCC acknowledges, 
reducing food waste would contribute to providing healthy diets to all 
people (IPCC, 2019 ). Food wasting occurs at every step of the food supply chain and direct 
consumers are responsible for its’ large proportion, especially in 
developed countries (Parfitt, Barthel, & Macnaughton, 2010 ). For 
example, it is estimated that in the European Union 53% of annual food 
waste (47 million tonnes) comes directly from households (Stenmarck 
et al., 2016 ). Although there is no golden standard for the estimation of 
food waste (van Herpen, van der Lans, Holthuysen, Nijenhuis-de Vries, 
& Quested, 2019 ), researchers aim to estimate household food waste 
and factors that contribute to it (Koivupuro et al., 2012 ; Stancu, Hau-
gaard, & Lahteenm aki, 2016 ; Williams, Wikstr om, Otterbring, Lofgren, 
& Gustafsson, 2012 ). Food wasting is an urgent and global problem, and 
understanding the mechanisms driving this behavior can significantly 
contribute to its reduction. It seems that one way to address the food waste problem can be 
education targeting the youngest generations, as this may change global 
food management in the long run, but also because children waste large 
quantities of food. For example, nearly a half of total food served to 
children at school in the US was wasted (Byker, Farris, Marcenelle, 
Davis, & Serrano, 2014 ). Some studies focused on food waste among 
children suggested superficial solutions, like reduction in offering chil-
dren foods they dislike (Biasini et al., 2019 ; Byker et al., 2014 ; Dre-
sler-Hawke, Whitehead, & Coad, 2009 ), nudging children to reduce food 
waste through using smaller plates (Wansink, Van Ittersum, & Payne, 
2014 ), limiting the availability of competitive food items (Marlette, 
Templeton, & Panemangalore, 2005 ), or scheduling meals at times that 
are synchronized with children ’s consummatory needs (Bergman, 
Buergel, Englund, & Femrite, 2004 )."
10-1016_j-jenvp-2021-101576.pdf,Union,"In a similar vein, organizational 
narcissism was associated with instrumental treatment of co-workers for 
personal benefits (Cichocka, Cislak, Gronfeldt, & Wojcik, 2021 ). Recent studies have also examined the role of national narcissism in 
the environmental context. National narcissism is associated with rejec-
tion of climate science (Bertin, Nera, Hamer, Uhl-Haedicke, & Delouv ˘ee, 
2021 ) as well as support for anti-environmental policies such as rein-
forcing carbon economy through subsidizing coal industry (Cislak, Woj-
cik, & Cichocka, 2018 ; see Ray, 1980 for similar findings for nationalism). Such policies might hurt ingroup members in the long run by increasing 
the risks of cognitive-related disorders (Calder ˘on-Garcidue ~nas et al., 
2008 ; Chen et al., 2017 ), lung diseases or even premature deaths (Euro-
pean Environment Agency, 2016 ). In line with the theorizing about 
ingroup image concerns, Cislak et al. (2018) observed that support for 
anti-environmental policies was motivated by asserting the ingroup image 
through resisting the influence of a powerful outgroup (in that case Eu-
ropean Union) on ingroup ’s decisions. Thus, it seems that for collective 
narcissists maintaining the ingroup image may be more important than 
maintaining the well-being of ingroup members. National narcissism 
should then be associated with willingness to support actions that are 
directly aimed at promoting a proenvironmental ingroup image, even 
when these actions lack actual environmental benefits. 1.3. Collective narcissism versus ingroup identification 
Importantly, we do not predict similar effects for those securely iden-
tified with their nation. Collective narcissism tends to be positively corre -
lated with ingroup identification (significance of and satisfaction with the 
ingroup and its members; Tajfel, 1978 ; see also Postmes, Haslam, & Jans, 
2013 ), because both assume a positive evaluation of the ingroup."
10-1016_j-jenvp-2021-101576.pdf,Union,"The final sample 
consisted of 350 women and 304 men, aged 18–85 (M 39.08, SD 
12.96). Sample size was dictated by financial considerations, although 
we aimed for a relatively large sample that would reflect national quotas 
in each group (i.e., 330 and 324 participants in the image-reinforcing 
and proenvironmental action groups, respectively). 3.1.2. Measures 
National narcissism (M 4.31, SD 1.46, α 0.88), national 
identification (M 5.18, SD 1.34, α 0.87), and political orientation 
(M 4.07, SD 1.40) were all measured as in Study 1. Support for the 
governmental image-reinforcing actions was measured with three items 
(e.g., “The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs should issue a declaration condemning the statement of President Macron ”, “Poland should 
dismiss our ambassador from France ”, “Poland should demand expla -
nations and an apology from the French embassy in Warsaw ”, M 4.16, 
SD 1.77, α 0.85). Support for the governmental proenvironmental 
actions was measured with three items (e.g., “The Polish Ministry of 
Energy should pass a law supporting renewable energy sources ”, 
“Poland should lend stronger support to the European Union and its 
policy of reducing greenhouse gas emissions ”, “Poland should introduce 
a special tax on power plants and other large carbon dioxide emitting 
companies ”, M 5.04, SD 1.47, α 0.77). Participants indicated the 
extent to which they agree with these items on an agreement scale from 
1 strongly disagree to 7 strongly agree . 3.2. Results 
Zero-order correlations are presented in Table 3. In line with past 
research, national narcissism and national identification were signifi -
cantly positively correlated. They were also both correlated with right-

(Morality/Social prop riety and Dynamism ). The results we obtained are comparable to the 
results of psycholexical studies exploring personality trai ts attributed to political  partie s in 
Poland  (Gorbaniuk et al., 2015) . Only three factors were extracted there, but all of them 
appear in a nearly identical form in the perception of Ukrainian politicians: Dishonesty, 
Disagreeableness, and  Self-Confidence . The Intellect dimension is not found in the perception 
of parties, which can be explained by the specificity of the perceived object. It is also worth 
noting the similarity of the identified dimensions to the dimensions distinguished based on the 
analysis of data from the 1972  ANES (Miller & Miller, 1976) . The Intellect dimension is 
partly identical in ter ms of content with the Competence  dimension , the Self-Confidence    
32 
 dimension  corresponds to  Reliability, while  Dishonesty  and Impulsivity  are the opposite of 
the Trust  dimension . The fairly high similarity of the structure of personality traits attributed 
to politicians in American and Ukrainian studies  as well as the fact that this s tructure differs  
from the f ive-factor model  of personality undermine  the legitimacy of using this model for the 
study of politicians’ perceived personality traits."

 1. Introduction  
Alcohol use is one of the most important factors contributing to the global heal th 
burden and costs to society (Rehm et al., 2009) . In the European Union, where alcohol 
consumption is among the highest in the world, approximately 14% of all deaths in men and 
approximately 8% of all deaths in women between 15 and 64 years of age are due to alcohol 
(Rehm et al ., 2012). These statistics support growing interest in developing successful 
treatment programs  for alcohol use disorder (AUD) . Despite consistent effort, the disorder is 
still characterized by persistent vulnerability to relapse even aft er specialized treatment (Moos 
& Moos 2006) . Two potential  factors that are significantly  relate d to relapse in AUD, are 
impulsivity and emotion  regulation. This paper examines differences between various  aspects 
of impulsivity and emotion  regulation across patients receiving treatment for AUD and 
healthy controls. According to Moeller and colleagues  (2001 ), impulsivity is “a predisposition toward 
rapid, unplanned reactions to internal or external stimuli without regard to the negative 
consequences of these reactions”  (p. 1784 )."

Furthermore, sexual education can help protect childrenfrom the harmful consequences of sexualization.

10-1016_j-jth-2018-04-001.pdf,Union,"Discussion
The present study provides further evidence that mobile phone use while driving is common and highlights the need for coun-
termeasures in the UK, as in many other developed countries. Almost 30% of participants reported answering calls while at the wheel
on a daily basis or more. Moreover, a similar proportion of drivers reported making calls and reading text messages while driving, and
more than one ﬁfth of the drivers reported sending texts. Not surprisingly, the proportion of hands-free users making and answering calls, on at least a daily basis, was higher than for
handheld users. This pattern of mobile phone use was also reported in a roadside observational study in England ( Sullman et al.,
2015), as well as research from New Zealand, Australia, Spain and Poland ( Gras et al., 2007; Przepiorka et al., 2018; Sullman and
Baas, 2004; White et al., 2010 ). This ﬁnding may be related to a lower perceived risk from using a hands-free device, as shown by the
present study and a survey of 27,000 drivers in the European Union ( European Commission, 2010). This low perceived risk is
worrying, as research evidence has not found hands-free mobile phones to be signi ﬁcantly safer (e.g., McEvoy et al., 2005;
Redelmeier and Tibshirani, 1997 ). Conversely, it may also be the case that those who buy hands-free devices are those who want to
talk more often on the phone while driving. With respect to the relationship between the frequency of use and beliefs, unlike White et al. (2010) andPrzepiorka et al. (2018) ,
no signi ﬁcant multivariate e ﬀects were found among hands-free users for any of the three types of beliefs evaluated."
10-1016_j-midw-2020-102646.pdf,Fund,"In addition,  as a similar  
number  of women  suffers from depression  in pregnancy,  the total 
number  of women  with perinatal  depression  symptoms  is a mini- 
mum of 92,0 0 0 – 93,0 0 0. The waiting  period for a standard  psychiatric  / psychological  
consultation  at public Mental  Health Clinics in large Polish cities 
varies from one month to one year (following  the data available  
on the webpage  presenting  the current  availability  status of med- 
ical specialists:  www.kolejki.nfz.gov.pl  ). This makes the access to 
a treatment  diﬃcult  or even impossible  for those women  who, for 
instance,  demonstrate  the symptoms  of antenatal  depression  in the 
third trimester  of pregnancy. In comparison  with the United King- 
dom ( Knight et al., 2017 ), in Poland there are no dedicated  peri- 
natal mental  health services  and no guidelines  concerning  referral. According  to the National  Institute  for Health and Care Excellence  
guidelines  (2014) , if a woman  has a sudden  onset of symptoms  
suggesting  postpartum  psychosis,  she should be referred  to an in- 
stant mental  health service  (preferably  a special  perinatal  mental  
health service)  for an immediate  assessment  (within  4 h of refer- 
ral). The data from the Polish National  Health Fund (2016) indicate  
that only a small percentage  of mentally  ill women  in perinatal  
period receive  help. In 2014, 6387 women  were diagnosed  with 
depressive  disorders  within the ﬁrst year after giving birth, and in 
2015 –5 1 3 3 . Only 21 cases in 2014 and 45 in 2015 were diagnosed  
with F53.0 code: mild mental and behavioural  disorders  related to 
childbirth,  not shown elsewhere:  Depression  after childbirth  (postna-  
tal) and postpartum  . The new perinatal  standard  in Poland (Regulation  of the Min- 
ister of Health of August  16, 2018 on the standard  of organiza-  
tional perinatal  care) aims to change  this situation:  it imposes  
the obligation  of screening  for perinatal  depression  symptoms  (a 
three-stage  screening  assessment  for depression  is now obligatory)  
on midwives. Yet, there are no general  guidelines  in Poland on 
how to screen for antenatal  and postnatal  depression. The Polish 
Psychiatric  Association  recommends  the use of the Patient Health 
Questionnaire-2  (PHQ-2)  as a screening  tool and the Patient Health 
Questionnaire-9  (PHQ9)  as an extended  test (if the result in the 
PHQ-2 is worrying)."

""The Programme  of education  and prevention  of postpartum  de-

sessions. Moreover,  if the symptoms  persist,  a specialist  suggests  a

10-1016_j-midw-2020-102646.pdf,Fund,"Discussion  
This study investigated  the Polish midwives’  knowledge  and 
skills in the early detection  of antenatal  and postpartum  depres-  
sion in the ﬁrst six months  after implementation  of the new stan- 
dard of perinatal  care (from January  to June 2019). As indicated  
in the introduction,  the new standard  of perinatal  care in Poland 
imposed  on midwives  the obligation  to monitor  the mental  state 
of women  in the perinatal  period (including  a screening  diagnosis  
for PPD). Before 2019, no systemic  guidelines  for monitoring  the 
mental  state of women  in the perinatal  period and for providing  
adequate  psychological  / psychiatric  care existed  in Poland. When 
feeling unwell,  a woman  could seek help on her own. However,  for 
many people (e.g. for ﬁnancial  reasons)  it was impossible  to re- 
ceive a proper and fast assistance  (a waiting  period for a refunded  
psychiatrist  consultation  after referral  by a GP could take several  
months),  due to the fact that such an assistance  was not previously  
reimbursed  by the National  Health Fund. Moreover,  new mothers  
usually  have little time to seek for a proper help - while on ma- 
ternity leave, they look after their child at home, rarely having a 
loved one to help. A stay in the hospital  under medical  staff’s care, C.-D. Magdalena  and W.-K. Tamara / Midwifery  83 (2020) 102646 7 
as well as mandatory  midwife  home visits, provide  an opportunity  
to initially  diagnose  and monitor  a mother’s  mental  state. Overall,  our results showed  that the midwives  perceived  their 
preparation  for such a screening  and providing  care for as being 
on a relatively  low level. The vast majority  of them (80%!) admit- 
ted that they were not adequately  educationally  prepared  for the 
screening  and care for women  with antenatal  depression  and/or 
PPD."

On the basis of an extensive  review of the literature,  a breastfeeding  
support  programme  had been created:  Motherhood:  step by step , which 
was subsequently  implemented  for the inhabitants  of the city of Gda ń sk, 
Poland,  in 2017. This programme  was an additional  form of support  for 
a standard  postpartum  care. After the discharge  from the hospital,  the 
standard  postpartum  care is delivered  by midwives  which includes  post- 
partum  home visits. The ﬁrst patronage  visit takes place no later than 
48 hours after leaving  the hospital  by a mother. Polish National  Health 
Fund ﬁnances  up to six home visits of midwives  in the ﬁrst 6 weeks post- 
partum. However,  according  to the survey carried by the Centre of the 
Studies  about Lactation  ( Ż ukowska-Rubik  and Nehring-Gugulska,  2017 ) 
this early support  is not eﬃcient  factor to promote  exclusive  breastfeed-  
ing. For example,  1/3 of the surveyed  women  indicated  that they had not received  help in solving  practical  lactation  problems. Whereas,  half of 
the surveyed  women  were not informed  about the recommended  length

feeding  diﬃculties. Midwives  who were enrolled  in the programme  were Certiﬁed  Lac-

1. Introduction
Many nations have a dif ﬁcult past with their neighbors, including
wars and other abuses. Although political leaders may decide to of ﬁcial-
ly reconcile with perpetrators in the name of the whole nation, individ-
ual citizens may have different attitudes toward this process. Individual
bitterness toward the invaders and oppressors may be deep and often
lasts for generations after atrocities have ended. But if future genera-
tions are to live in peace, forgiveness is essential. It may be granted
not only in the name of the nation —forgiveness may also be based on
broader social categories, such as shared humanity, religion (e.g."
10-1016_j-paid-2016-09-058.pdf,Union,"Thus, the
mutual relationship of national and supranational identi ﬁcations with
intergroup forgiveness needs more detailed exploration. In the two studies described in this article, an individual difference
approach was employed to look at the strength of people's identi ﬁcation
with all humanity as stable individual characteristics ( McFarland &
Hornsby, 2015; McFarland, Brown, & Webb, 2013; McFarland, Webb,
& Brown, 2012 ). We hypothesize that supranational identi ﬁcations,
such as identi ﬁcation with all humanity, fosters intergroup forgiveness,
whereas national identi ﬁcation impedes it. Taking such an approach al-
lows the exploration of the inconsistency of the effects of national iden-tiﬁcation on intergroup forgiveness obtained in previous research. We
argue that this inconsistency is due to the dual character of national
identi ﬁcation, having a positive component (a general sense of belong-
ing shared with broad supranational identi ﬁcations) fostering inter-
group forgiveness, and a negative component (a sense of national
distinctiveness and conformity toward group interest) that hinders in-
tergroup forgiveness. To examine these ideas, we have conducted two
studies, measuring both national and supranational identi ﬁcations
(with all humanity and with the European Union) as well as intergroupPersonality and Individual Differences 105 (2017) 257 –263

is why, in Study 2 we examined willingness of Poles to grant forgiveness

2.1. The role of national identi ﬁcation in intergroup forgiveness —mixed
results
Although in-group favoritism does not necessarily cause negative
treatment of outgroups (e.g."

In the process of reconciliation “victims and perpetrators ( …)c o m e
to see the humanity of one another, accept each other, and see the pos-
sibility of a constructive relationship ”(Staub, 2006 , p. 868). We can ex-
pect this process to be easier for people with higher levels ofidenti ﬁcation with humanity. This quality of those who identify with
all humanity suggests that IWAH should predict intergroup forgiveness,even of groups who have in ﬂicted severe suffering on one's in-group
(Hypothesis 1). Moreover, on the basis of the research on supranational identi ﬁca-
tions (see e.g. Hamer, 2015 ), we can expect a similar relationship be-
tween forgiveness and other supranational identi ﬁcations (e.g. the
European Union identi ﬁcation for European national groups). In a series
of studies, Hamer (in press, 2015) showed a strong relation between Eu-
ropean identi ﬁcation and IWAH, and a similar structure of their predic-
tors. Strong positive predictors of both supranational identi ﬁcations
include empathy (especially empathic concern and perspective taking),the value of universalism (tolerance) and openness to experience, with258 K. Hamer et al. / Personality and Individual Differences 105 (2017) 257 –263the social dominance orientation as its strong negative predictor. There-
fore, we hypothesize that a high level of identi ﬁcation with the Europe-
an Union as an individual characteristic is also positively connected tointergroup forgiveness (Hypothesis 2). Finally, we explore whether the tendency to identify with others in a
broad way could explain the inconsistent results concerning the rela-
tionship between national identi ﬁcation and intergroup forgiveness,
with the former hindering the latter in some studies, but not in others
(Hewstone et al., 2004, 2006; Philpot & Hornsey, 2011 )."

(Hewstone et al., 2004, 2006; Philpot & Hornsey, 2011 ). We believe
that the key to understand the contradictory ﬁndings of the effects of
national identi ﬁcation on intergroup forgiveness may lie in the dual
character of national identi ﬁcation. Measures of national identi ﬁcation
capture both a general sense of belonging, a sense shared with suprana-
tional identi ﬁcations, and a more speci ﬁc sense of in-group distinctive-
ness. The sense of belonging might overlap with superordinate levels ofidentiﬁ cation (such as EU identi ﬁcation or global human identi ﬁcation)
and it should foster forgiveness toward other members of such broadcategories. On the other hand, the sense of in-group distinctiveness
and in-group loyalty as well as feelings of similarity with the victims
may be a barrier to forgiveness —people strongly identifying with
their nation would be reluctant to forgive, because it could mean forthem a treason of in-group norms."

facet associated with supranational identi ﬁcations and another with
an ethnocentric identi ﬁcation only with one's own nation, we hypothe-
size that controlling for a part shared with supranational identi ﬁcations
would reveal a negative relationship between national identi ﬁcation
and intergroup forgiveness (Hypothesis 3). These three hypotheses were tested in two cross-sectional studies. In the ﬁrst, we examined the effects of national identi ﬁcation and two
supranational identi ﬁcations (with European Union inhabitants and
with all humanity) on forgiveness granted by Poles to Germans in the
context of World War II and Nazi occupation of Poland. In the second
study, performed on a larger, nationwide sample, we aimed at replicat-
ing the main ﬁndings in the context of willingness to forgive two differ-
ent groups of perpetrators of Polish suffering during World War II:Germans and Russians. This context allowed the testing of whether
the superordinate identi ﬁcations affect the level of forgiveness toward
the groups belonging to shared categories (e.g. Germans in the contextof the EU category), as opposed to the ones that do not belong to them(e.g. Russians in the context of the EU category). 3."

toward Germans and national identiﬁ cation is due to the existence of

ness. Since these ways vary in valence, national identi ﬁcation in general
is not related to forgiveness. We expected, however, that the relation-ship would appear, if common variance with broader identities was

change in the relationship between national identi ﬁcation and inter-
group forgiveness was statistically signi ﬁcant (CI = [0.12, 0.32]). Adding identi ﬁcation with all humanity as a predictor of intergroup for-

dictor of forgiveness."

Study 1 revealed the expected relationships in the Polish –German
context among students. We decided to replicate the study on a
broader, nationwide sample, adding a different group of perpetrators
and a different con ﬂict. Additionally, we decided to study the effects
that superordinate and national identi ﬁcations might have on those
groups that are not members of such superordinate categories. This is
why we analyzed the levels of forgiveness granted by Poles to Russians,
who are not members of one of the studied superordinate categories
(the European Union), at the same time being members of the second
one (shared humanity). Therefore, we expected human identi ﬁcation
(shared by Poles, Russians and Germans) to be a more important pre-dictor of forgiveness toward Russians, whereas EU identi ﬁcation
(shared by Poles and Germans) to be a key predictor of forgiveness to-ward Germans, as it is the lowest superordinate category linking these
two nations. Based on the CIIM ( Gaertner & Dovidio, 2000 ), we expect-
ed that the lowest level of identi ﬁcation shared with perpetrators
should foster forgiveness to a greater extent (Hypothesis 4). 4.1. Method

tional identi ﬁcations which includes both victims and perpetrators is
sufﬁcient to foster forgiveness toward former enemies and is its more
important predictor (EU identi ﬁcation for Poles and Germans, global
human identi ﬁcation for Poles and Russians). 5. General discussion
The aim of the current research was to understand ways in which so-
cial identi ﬁcations (national and supranational) affect the levels of for-
giveness granted by members of victimized groups. In the line of two
studies, in which superordinate and national identities were measuredas individual difference variables, we showed that superordinate identi-
ﬁcations (either with speci ﬁc region, such as Europe, or with all human-
ity in general) have systematic positive effects on intergroupforgiveness. Superordinate identi ﬁcation predicts forgiveness toward
all those groups that are members of the shared category (e.g. Poles for-giving Russians as long as they identify with all humanity; Poles forgiv-
ing Germans as long as they identify with the European Union). The
detrimental role of national identi ﬁcation in intergroup forgiveness is
more nuanced: the negative effects of national identi ﬁcation on forgive-
ness were visible mainly after the common variance with supranational
identiﬁ cations was controlled for. This suggests that national identi ﬁca-
tion might be a two-component structure: the part of it that overlapswith superordinate identities is enhancing forgiveness, whereas the
more “separatist ”part of such identi ﬁcation decreases peoples' willing-
ness to forgive historical enemies. The importance of superordinate identity as a uniting element is at
the heart of many contemporary and classic theories of intergroup rela-tions ( Greenaway et al., 2011 ). Most existing literature stresses that the
situationally induced awareness of common in-group membership fa-cilitates forgiveness —therefore most existing studies have triggered ei-
ther common or separate group membership (see e.g. Cehajic et al.,
2008; Greenaway et al., 2011; Wohl & Branscombe, 2004, 2005 )."

body of evidence shows the power of situationally activated commonidenti ﬁcation in the intergroup forgiveness process. Our research cor-
roborates those ﬁndings by also showing that when taking a more dis-
positional focus, the stable levels of national and supranational
identiﬁ cations have important effects on peoples' willingness to forgive. In our research we followed an individual difference approach, pro-
posed by McFarland ( McFarland et al., 2012, 2013; McFarland &
Hornsby, 2015 ;s e ea l s o Hamer, in press, 2015; Hamer & Gutowski,

 tion with all humanity as individual char-
acteristics that stem from a tendency to identify in a broad way, con-nected to empathy, openness to experience and universalistic values. In the current research, we found that such supranational identi ﬁca-
tions (with the EU and with all humanity) enhanced intergroup forgive-ness. These effects were observed not only on the student sample
(Study 1), but also on the large nationwide sample of adult citizens
(Study 2). Moreover, as the results of Study 2 revealed, while taking into con-
sideration shared variance between both supranational identi ﬁcations
(EU and human), the lowest level of identi ﬁcation which includes
both victims and perpetrators is a suf ﬁcient factor enhancing intergroup
forgiveness (EU identi ﬁcation in the case of Poles forgiving Germans,
global human identi ﬁcation in the case of Poles forgiving Russians). Therefore, our research showed that Poles who identify strongly withpeople all over the world are more prone to forgive harms in ﬂicted by
Russians during World War II to their ancestors or fellow citizens thanare low identi ﬁers. Similarly, Poles who strongly identify with the Euro-
pean Union are more prone to forgive harms in ﬂicted by Germans dur-
ing World War II to their ancestors or fellow citizens than those Poles
who identify with the European Union on a lower level."

the results of previous research concerning national identi ﬁcation and
intergroup forgiveness. As noted earlier in this article, some studies
found their negative connection (e.g. Hewstone et al., 2006; Noor et
al., 2008a ), but others did not (e.g. Hewstone et al., 2004, 2006;
Philpot & Hornsey, 2011 ). Another good example of this inconsistency

giveness toward Russians."

theﬁndings from social and political psychology with the personality

ture, natural experiments “on the street ”were conducted, in order to in-
vestigate real social behaviors as opposed to the subtle cognition effects
of paper-and-pencil measures in laboratory. With the exception of some
rare studies (e.g. Shariff & Norenzayan, 2007 ), research on religion and
sociality has rarely investigated behavior per se, and in particular, re-
search has only indirectly tested the love thy neighbor hypothesis by ex-
amining associations between multiple measures of religiosity (see
Shen, Haggard, Strassburger, & Rowatt, 2013 for review). Levine, Norenzayan & Philbrick (2001) have already analyzed help-
ing behaviors across cultures in 23 large cities but they did not vary
the religious identity of the victim in need. Therefore, as a contribution
to the theory, we decided to investigate the effect of the religious iden-
tity of the target of intervention on helping behavior in Study 1. Taking
into consideration, that in Poland 97.35% of people declare that they are
Christians ( National Census of Population and Housing, 2013 ), making
Polish society a very monolithic religious group, we decided to explore
behavioral reactions toward a religious in-group member or an religious
outsider by varying the religiosity of the target. It was assumed that the
Christian nun and priest appearance would activate the “Good Samari-
tan”attitude in randomly selected helpers coming from the same Chris-
tian denomination, the same as the crosses that adorn Christians'
jewelry activate Christian identity ( McCullough, Swartwout, Shaver,
Carter, & Sosis, 2016 ). Based on experiments conducted by
McCullough et al. (2016) , it was also assumed that the Muslim and
Jew appearance would activate strangers' religious identities: Muslim
women's headscarves ( hijab ) and the stars of David and yarmulkes
that some Jews wear all advertise their wearers' religious identities (as
badgewearers ). The assumption was also based on the earlier priming
line of experimental studies, in which the activation of religious schema
has been demonstrated to increase prosocial behavior ( Shariff &
Norenzayan, 2007 ); where a religious priming effect was present re-
gardless of the level of participant religiosity (see Galen, 2012 for re-
view). Also we took into account ﬁ
ndings that when most of the
society is nominally Christian, this identity constitutes a “default ”,s o
that even those who do not disclose a religious identity are presumed
to be Christian ( Gervais, Shariff, & Norenzayan, 2011 )."
10-1016_j-paid-2016-11-009.pdf,religious* group,"Theologically, most biblical scholars argue that
the point of the parable was to demonstrate that one's identity and help-
ing behavior should move beyond ethnic boarders to include all humans
as their “neighbor. ”However, our studied examined reductions in help-
ing toward out-group members; so in practice, this golden rule can be
expressed as the more pragmatic and egoistic motive of “love thy neigh-
bor who is similar to you ”. Also, the religious in-group seems to have
higher compliance for breaking social norms that is permitted for the re-
ligious outsider. The results from Study 2 con ﬁrmed the hypothesis that
customers would become assertive when they saw a Jew queue-jumping
(even more so than if they saw a secular man doing the same thing), be-
cause this was a violation of the rule about queuing. Customer turned a
blind eye to a religious in-group member what can be viewed as an ex-
ample of compliance with social norms (not being against the sacred au-
thority); however such effect does not apply to religious outsider. Ourﬁndings are consistent with studies about the in ﬂuence of the
identity of the target of prosociality on prosocial behavior displayed by
religious individuals ( Norenzayan & Shariff, 2008 ); with studies
conﬁrming positive associations between religiosity and hostility to-
ward out-groups ( Hall, Matz, & Wood, 2010 ) or atheists ( Gervais et
al., 2011 ); with studies that identifying with a religious group provides
individuals with a belief system and set of norms relating to everyday
life and that these beliefs and norms reduce feelings of uncertainty
(Hogg, Adelman, & Blagg, 2010 ); also with ﬁndings that people are
more likely to be cooperative and exercise more personal restraint
when using endangered common resources being shared with in-group members rather than with out-group members, because social
identity seems to act as social glue providing stability in group ( Van
Vugt & Hart, 2004 ). Given results can be interpreted in the context of intergroup rela-
tions theory and studies, where attitudes toward religious in-group
members were very positive and attitudes toward nonreligious otherswere quite negative ( Jackson & Hunsberger, 1999 ). The perception of
prosociality as a characteristic of religious individuals is an intergroup
phenomenon, with favoritism determined, in part, by the degree to
which an individual is perceived as a member of one's own religious
group ( Tinoco, 1998 ).Saroglou (2006) has suggested the term minimal
prosociality to refer to a higher degree of helping on the part of religious
people that is extended to friends and in-group members but not to out-
group members and those who threaten religious values. In addition,
greater religious humanitarianism is reserved only for in-group mem-
bers ( Hall et al., 2010 ). This suggests that religion per se is to some ex-
tent responsible for antipathy between groups, in that religious groups
function according to the same principles as political, ethnic or other
groups. A tendency to respond negatively to out-group members is per-
vasive among people who identify with their religious in-group mem-
bers ( Jackson & Hunsberger, 1999 ), because so doing enhances their
collective self-esteem ( Tajfel & Turner, 1986 )."

in a homogeneous context but not in heterogeneous groups or out-

vasive among people who identify with their religious in-group mem-
bers ( Jackson & Hunsberger, 1999 ), because so doing enhances their
collective self-esteem ( Tajfel & Turner, 1986 ). It seems that activation of the “love thy neighbor ”attitude is posi-
tively associated with universal cooperation and helping behavior only
in a homogeneous context but not in heterogeneous groups or out-
group member even religious, wherein individuals perceive a con ﬂict
of interests between their group and other religious groups. Such ﬁnd-
ings con ﬁrmed empirically the theoretical background presented by
Galen (2012) , who assumed that when studies assess prosociality in
nonplanned, spontaneous context (e.g. bystander helping) and if the
target of prosociality is an out-group member, the relationship between
religiosity and prosociality is essentially zero, or even negative. Our results are also consisted with empirical ﬁndings regarding
religion's dual function as a social identity and as a belief system. Reli-
gion offers epistemological and ontological certainty and these can pro-
mote individual well-being (e.g., by increasing the availability of social
support and providing a sense of belonging to religious group), but it si-
multaneously serves as a basis for seemingly intractable intergroup con-
ﬂicts ( Ysseldyk, Matheson, & Anisman, 2010 ). Our ﬁndings ﬁnally
conﬁrm that people use religious identity to regulate their social behav-
ior toward in-group and out-group members. As McCullough et al. (2016) found that people actively seek out information about other
people's religious identity when deciding who to trust, our ﬁnal contri-
bution to the literature is providing con ﬁrmation that people actively
seek out information about other people's religious identity also when
deciding who to help and whether or not to protest against an
individual's behavior. This all leads to the conclusion that it is better
not to show religious diversity and it is better to hide an atheistic atti-
tude when one is in a needy situation, especially in a religious monolith-
ic society. One limitation of our studies is that the manipulation of religious
identity was carried out “on the street ”, which is not as clari ﬁed as lab-
oratory measures."

participants' propensity to invest in bonds, mutual funds, and shares,
the participants were asked to create an investment portfolio by
indicating what percentage of a hypothetical amount of money (PLN
10,000) they would want to allocate to a variety of ﬁnancial market
instruments. The participants could invest their hypothetical money inbonds, balanced mutual funds (investing 50% in stock and 50% in

or more of the instruments mentioned above (e.g., they could allocatethe entire amount of money to di ﬀerent investment instrument
categories). The task also measured the general riskiness of thecreated portfolio ( riskiness of portfolio )r eﬂected by the percentage of

10-1016_j-paid-2018-12-019.pdf,Union,"In terms of motivational
goals universalism-tolerance is defined as the “acceptance and under-
standing of those who are different from oneself” (Schwartz et al., 2012,
p. 669). We therefore placed it in the proposed model next to the
personality trait of openness to experience, formulating Hypothesis 3
that universalism-tolerance will be a direct positive predictor of IWAH. We also formulated Hypothesis 3a, that universalism-tolerance will also
be an indirect predictor of IWAH, as it is negatively connected to RWA
and SDO, which are hypothetically negative predictors of IWAH (see
Fig. 1). 2.4. The“lethalunion”(RWAandSDO)andIWAH
In recent years, right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social
dominance orientation (SDO), due to their independent but combined
effects upon ethnocentric attitudes and behaviors labeled as the “lethal
union” (Altemeyer, 1998, p. 88), have been treated as a twin construct -
the dual processes leading to generalized prejudice (McFarland, 2010a;
McFarland et al., 2012). Many studies have shown that SDO and RWA
are indeed rather independent of each other, but both are strong pre-
dictors of prejudice toward various outgroups (e.g. Altemeyer, 1998;
Asbrock, Sibley & Duckitt, 2010; Ekehammar, Akrami, Gylje &
Zakrisson, 2004; Ekehammar, Akrami, & Yang-Wallentin, 2009;
McFarland, 2010a, b). SDO and RWA also show the same trend toward
a rejection of universalism (Livi, Leone, Falgares, & Lombardo, 2014). Although RWA predicts a dislike of socially threatening groups,
whereas SDO leads to prejudice against low status outgroups (Duckitt &
Sibley, 2010), they both seem to be orientations that are antithetical to
IWAH (McFarland et al., 2012). Their negative relationship with IWAH
was confirmed in previous studies (McFarland et al., in press)."
10-1016_j-paid-2018-12-019.pdf,Union,"Both McFarland (2010b)
andDunwoody and McFarland (2018) found that the effects of RWA
upon IWAH were fully mediated through ethnocentrism, while the ef-fects of SDO upon ethnocentrism were partially, but not fully, mediated
through ethnocentrism. Additionally, McFarland (2010b) showed that
generalized prejudice reduced IWAH rather than IWAH reducing gen-
eralized prejudice. We used these findings to modify the proposed structural model of
IWAH predictors, in such a way that the direct effect of RWA upon
IWAH is mediated through ethnocentrism, with SDO being linked to
IWAH directly and indirectly, through ethnocentrism. The modified
model is shown in Fig. 3. We therefore hypothesize that ethnocentrism will mediate the re-
lationship between “lethal union” traits (RWA, SDO) and IWAH
(Hypothesis 5), and that ethnocentrism will be a direct negative pre-
dictor of identification with all humanity (Hypothesis 6). In order to

10-1016_j-paid-2018-12-019.pdf,Union,"Summaryanddiscussion
There are significant individual differences between people in their
levels of identification with all humanity (IWAH, also called global
human identification, see McFarland et al., in press), treated as a stable
tendency to identify with others in a broad manner. These differences
can be seen in the results of large opinion polls (e.g. Hamer & Gutowski,
2009) and studies using smaller samples (Hamer, Drogosz et al., 2017;
Hamer, McFarland et al., 2018; McFarland & Webb, 2003; McFarland
et al., 2012, 2013, in press), as well as in studies comparing social
identifications between specific groups of people (see e.g. Hamer, 2011,
in preparation; McFarland et al., 2012, in press). This article proposed
and tested the model of the possible psychological characteristics un-
derlying this phenomenon. Earlier studies have shown the role of multiple variables as corre-
lates and possible predictors of IWAH that have thus far been studiedseparately: personality traits, empathy, universalistic values, the “lethal
union” (SDO and RWA) and ethnocentrism (see e.g. McFarland et al.,
under review). On the basis of psychological theories and previous re-
search, the model of such predictors was proposed (see Figs. 1 and 3)
and tested in two cross-sectional studies using structural equationmodeling. We expected a higher level of IWAH to be directly predicted by
higher levels of openness to experience, empathy (perspective taking
and empathic concern) and universalism-tolerance. Both studies con-
firmed these relationships."

Short Communication
Women in prisons. Personality and temperamental characteristics
Wiola Friedrich⁎
Institute of Psychology, University of Silesia in Katowice, Poland
1. Introduction
Imprisoned women constitute a small proportion of the entire prison
population. According to Eurostat data (2017) , the percentage of im-
prisoned women ranges between the European Union Member States
from approximately 7– 8% in Slovenia, Latvia, Finland, Spain, Hungary,
the Czech Republic and Slovakia to approximately 3 –4% in Bulgaria,
France, Ireland, Croatia and Poland. This small percentage of women
(compared to the entire population of prisoners) results in the fact that
female study groups are not so commonly analyzed. When deviant
behaviors were investigated in non-o ﬀending samples, most studies also
concentrated on male groups. However, a small amount of research onwomen's crime does not mean that this group is less important or sig-
niﬁcant in correctional research in relation to imprisoned men. When
studies are conducted among imprisoned women, special attention isoften paid to women perpetrators of sexual and violent crimes and ju-
venile female perpetrators. To date, only a few researchers (e.g.,
Brunelle et al., 2009; Hicks et al., 2010 ) have attempted to distinguish
between the types of female perpetrators."

and the ecological model of four domains of active living (Sallis et al., 2006) have two common 
cognitive predictors of child overweight: child per ceptions of safety and accessibility. Importantly, these two models propose that respecti ve perceptions may be directly associated 
with child PA (Davison & Birch, 2001; Sallis et al. , 2006) and that child perceptions directly 
predict child overweight (Davison & Birch, 2001). F inally, as suggested in ecological model of 
predictors of child overweight (Davison & Birch, 20 01) parental perceptions and behaviors are MANUSCRIPT

also direct predictors of child body fat. Thus, the  present study examined if parental and child PA 
as well as parental and child perceptions of access ibility and safety of the PA environment were 
direct predictors of body fat in children. Evidence for perceptions of environment—PA associat ions was gathered mostly in cross-
sectional studies (Bauer et al., 2011; Bélanger-Gra vel et al., 2015; Forthofer et al., 2016). Similarly, the associations between PA and obesity among children and parents were usually 
tested in cross-sectional studies (for review see: Jiménez-Pavón et al., 2010). Furthermore, 
research on relationships between child PA and perc eptions of accessibility or safety usually 
accounted for child perceptions only (e.g., Carroll -Scott et al., 2013) or parental perceptions only 
(e.g. Bauer et al., 2011). Some of these shortcomin gs were addressed in recent research. For 
example, perceptions of the environment (measured i n parents) correlated with PA and body 
composition (measured in children) (Bauer et al., 2 011) whereas perceptions of support for PA 
(measured in parents) were associated with child PA  (Loprinzi & Trost, 2010)."
10-1016_j-psychsport-2017-09-007.pdf,Associat,"In the subgroup of 
dyads with children with overweight/obesity, respec tively 80% and 75% variance of child body 
fat (T2) and 12% and 50% of child PA (T2) were expl ained. Discussion 
To our knowledge this is the first prospective stud y providing an insight into dyadic 
associations among parental and child perceptions o f PA environment, PA, and body fat. Dyadic 
data indicated that parental, not child perceptions  of accessibility of PA facilities predicted body 
fat percentage among children. The effect of parent al perceptions of accessibility seems to be 
robust, as it was observed for self-reported PA amo ng children and for child body composition 
(an objective measure of body fat). These effects w ere observed in the total sample, in the 
subsample of dyads with children with overweight/ob esity, and in the subsample of dyads with 
children with normal body weight. Although associat ions between perceived accessibility or 
safety and PA were often studied (Humpel et al., 20 02; Pocock et al., 2010; Sallis et al., 2006) 
the research so far investigated these processes in  parents only or children only, or accounted for 
parental perceptions but child behaviors only (Baue r et al., 2011; Carroll-Scott et al., 2013). Our 
study went two steps further: first, it accounted f or the associations between perception and 
behavior in parent-child dyads, and second, the obj ective indicator of body fat composition was 
applied. In sum, our dyadic study explains how pare ntal and child variables (perceptions, PA, MANUSCRIPT

and body fat) operate together and therefore it off ers an insight into dyadic mechanisms which 
may lead to a reduction of body fat among children. This study showed no effects of safety perceptions on child PA and body fat at follow-
ups. Systematic reviews showed significant, but wea ker associations between perceived safety 
and PA, compared to associations found for perceive d accessibility and PA (Humpel et al., 
2002). In sum, our findings tend to be in line with  those weaker effects of safety perceptions, 
which seem to be non-significant in predicting obes ity of younger children."
10-1016_j-psyneuen-2021-105325.pdf,Union,"Our study participants were mainly young adults 
(M24.4 years) and given that younger sexual minority persons are 
more exposed to sexual minority stressors, among them burden associ -
ated with the coming out (Bruce et al., 2015; Russell and Fish, 2016 ), it 
is justified to expect that gay men in our sample will still show elevated 
cortisol levels. This interpretation is also consistent with the fact that 
older age among gay participants predicted decreased cortisol levels. Therefore, it is possible that the differences between Juster et al. (2015) , who observed diminished cortisol responses to acute stress in 
sexual minority men, and our research can be attributed to the differ -
ences in actual exposure to sexual minority stigma in studied pop-
ulations. Aforementioned study (Juster et al., 2015 ) was conducted in 
Canada (Montreal) which has some of the most progressive policies on 
sexual minorities. Our research was conducted in Poland, which has 
recently been rated by ILGA-Europe (ILGA-Europe, 2020 ) as a country 
with the worst human rights situation of LGBT people in the European 
Union. This includes both lack of legal protection from hate speech or 
hate crimes, and no legal recognition of same-sex relationships or 
adoption rights for same-sex couples. Nearly 70% of LGBT participants 
in a study conducted by The Campaign Against Homophobia revealed 
being exposed to at least one type of violence (including verbal abuse, threats, or physical violence) due to their gender or sexual identity 
within two years preceding the data collection (˘Swider et al., 2017 ). According to the same study only 25% of mothers and 12% of fathers 
fully accepted sexual or gender identity of their LGBT children (˘Swider 
et al., 2017 ). In our study, the cortisol concentrations among gay participants 
were also associated with two dimensions of sexual minority stigma: the 
perceived rejection from family members due to minority sexuality, and 
the vicarious trauma defined as feelings of distress associated with 
learning about discrimination experienced by other LGBT individuals. Greater perceived stigma associated with family rejection predicted 
higher cortisol levels, and greater vicarious trauma was associated with 
diminished total cortisol."
10-1016_j-resglo-2019-100007.pdf,Union,"Whether it will be threatening or favourable to an individual
depends largely on his/her own attributes. Therefore, in the current
research, three such characteristics were taken into account: the attitudes
toward the contemporary world, the perception of personal material re-
sources, and, as well, the stage of life (of development) of an individual. Thus, the aim of the research was to identify people's differences in atti-
tudes toward the contemporary world, together with personal resources
(which are strongly related to the life situation of people in different age
groups –Lindskog, Brege, Senejko, &Los, 2016 ). In this study, the participants were citizens of Poland; for this reason,
below are presented the most important facts regarding recent Polish
history. 1.3. Poland and poles in the contemporary world
As an outcome of the post-war division of Europe, Poland was in the so-
cialist bloc of countries, subordinated to the Soviet Union. Despite such a
situation, Poles were turning to such values as individual freedom and
equality of citizens. As a consequence, in 1989 Poland entered the path of
economic and political transition. This meant a far-reaching opening to-
ward the values of Western culture, entry into the free market economy,
etc. In the socioeconomic sphere, the process of polarization thereupon
started, dividing citizens into those who could adapt to a new environmentand acquire wealth quickly versus those who are signi ﬁcantly poorer and
less resourceful. The ensuing political changes in Poland have in ﬂuenced its citizens in a
substantial way."

perceiving creative students in terms of adaptive behaviors varied significantly between coun-tries. Cognitive characteristics were the most dominant in creative students’ perception, followed
by Adaptiveness and Nonconformism. Findings are discussed in light of potential opportunities
and limitations to support creativity in school settings. 1. Introduction
Teachers play a key role in developing creativity in their students. As the Council of the European Union (2008/C 319/08)
recognized: “schools have a duty to provide their pupils with an education which will enable them to adapt to an increasingly
globalised, competitive, diversified and complex environment, in which creativity, the ability to innovate, a sense of initiative,
entrepreneurship and a commitment to continue learning are just as important as the specific knowledge of a given subject” (pp. 20–22). It is an increasingly common expectation that teachers support creativity in their students. In fact, this may be one of the
most important goals teachers are faced with (Cachia & Ferrari, 2010; Craft, 2003). However, quite often there is a clash between the
declarative support of creativity, such as found in teachers’ self-reports (Aljughaiman & Mowrer-Reynolds, 2005), and the everyday
reality of school education (Dawson, 1997; Gajda, Karwowski, & Beghetto, 2017; Westby & Dawson, 1995). Previous studies suggest that because teachers’ attention is focused on educational goals other than creativity (Cachia, Ferrari,
Ala-Mutka,&Punie,2010; Heilmann&Korte,2010), theyrarelyundertakeactionsaimed atsupportingthecreativepotentialoftheir
students(Beghetto, 2010; Gralewski,2016)."
10-1016_j-tsc-2020-100636.pdf,Union,"Two of them, Australia
and the UK, are characterized by explicit support for creativity in education as recognized by government education policy makers
and a long tradition of incorporating creativity into the curriculum (see e.g., Burnard & White, 2008; Cropley, 2012; National
Advisory Committee on Creative and Cultural Education (NACCCE), 1999; Woods, 1995; Wyse & Ferrari, 2015). The remaining two,

2the countries with the lowest official appreciation and recognition of creativity in national curricula (see Cachia et al., 2010; Wyse &
Ferrari, 2015). For example, Cachia et al. (2010) revealed that the frequency of terms such as creativity and innovation in Polish and
Italian curricula documents were comparatively low when compared to other countries in the European Union. Although in Poland
there is a long tradition of preparing teachers who focus on creativity (see Karwowski, Gralewski, Lebuda, & Wiśniewska, 2007), and
Polish researchers who study creativity in education are present internationally (see Hernandez-Torrano & Ibrayeva, 2020, for a
recent summary), this poorly translates into the reality of the school, with creativity being rather absent from curricula (Gralewski,
2019). 3. The present study
The present study focused on the structure and characteristics of teachers’ perceptions of the qualities of a creative student. By
surveying a large (933 individuals) and diversified (representing four countries and many different age levels and subjects taught)
sample of teachers, we aimed to examine the structure of their implicit theories of creativity and provide a description of the most
typical profile of creative students. Although we relied on a large sample, due to the lack of a perfect comparability of participating
teachers (see details below), our goal was not to compare teachers from each country, but rather to explore the extent to which the
structureofimplicittheoriesmaybeconsideredsimilarandgeneralizable,andwhatfactorsdominateinimplicittheoriesofcreativity

high quality, ensuring that the public at large has access to fact -checked, well organized and well

may not be enough. Researchers argue that a reliable crisis response system should use 
combined data from Wikipedia, local government information systems and social media (Huang 
et al., 2017) . While Wikipedia pageviews may serve as an indicator of how much people seek 
reliable information on a disastrous event, the virality of social media posts can be regarded as a 
proxy of the scale of the social activation around it  (Gozzi et al., 2020) . People increasingly rely 
on social media as the quickest and most accessible source of information (Kusumasari and 
Prabowo,  2020) . Hashtags such as #StrongerThanWinston popular after the Cyclone Winston 
strike helped to increase awareness among the global community, coordinate fund -raising and 
social support (Finau et al.,  2018) . It should be noted that reactions to breaking news are not politically neutral: for instance, 
Trump -voting Florida residents were 10 to 11 percentage points less likely to evacuate Hurricane 
Irma than Clinton voters (Long et al., 2020) . Neither is coverage of events proportional to the 
scale of disaster worldwide. Wikipedia reporting of ongoing disasters tends to be skewed towards 
wealthier and English -speaking countries such as the US and Cana da (Lorini et al., 2020) , leaving 
coverage of regions that have less editors, although more readers, behind. We found a similar 
trend in our data from English Wikipedia: views and editions peaked durin g the North Atlantic 
Ocean hurricane season, but not for the Pacific Typhoon season, for example. Moreover, high

communicate without apparent difﬁculties. A great deal of evidence about how bilingual language
control works comes from studies in which participants
are asked to switch between languages. The vast majorityof these studies have placed participants in language
contexts in which the two languages are required to
be used with relatively similar frequency, resemblingconversational contexts in which the two languages are at
play. In our study, we build on this evidence and explore
whether the patterns of language switching are affectedby the relative frequency with which each language is
called into action. That is, we artiﬁcially create a language
context in which one of the languages (dominant L1 or thenon-dominant L2) is used more frequently than the other
one."
10-1017_sjp-2019-16.pdf,Fund,"They also stress a strong and urgent need for policy intervention to help people become more finan-cially literate. Financial literacy is usually measured using tasks 
that require understanding financial concepts (e.g. “Do you think that the following statement is true or false? ’Bonds are normally riskier than stocks.’”) or solving 
financial tasks (e.g., “Suppose you have $100 in a sav-ings account and the interest rate is 20% per year and you never withdraw money or interest payments. After 
5 years, how much would you have in this account in 
total?”). These measures predict a wide range of financial behaviors such as having an emergency fund, credit and checking fees, positive savings, etc. (Fernandes et al., 2014). However, these relationships became 
weaker or even insignificant when controlling for cog-
nitive variables (e.g., numeracy, consumer confidence investing, planning for money, willingness to take investment risks) suggesting the presence of omitted 
important cognitive variables in many studies on 
financial literacy. A recent study of Skagerlund, Lind, Strömbäck, Tinghög, and Västfjäll (2018) suggests that numeracy provides the ’computational engine’ behind financial operations and as a result can be the central 
component of this construct. In this study conducted 
on a representative sample of the general Swedish 
population, Skagerlund et al. (2018) found that objec-
tive numeracy was the strongest predictor of financial literacy, even when controlling for demographics (e.g., age, gender, education, income) and cognitive and 
emotional factors (e.g., cognitive reflection, self-efficacy, 
mathematics, and financial anxiety)."

Thisresearch suggests that the tendency to maximize in romantic rela-tionships is negatively related to the commitment and the satisfac-tion people have to and with their romantic relationships. Although research on maximizing in romantic relationships
concerns a type of interpersonal relationship, these results cannotbe generalized to other types of interpersonal relationships becauseromantic and nonromantic interpersonal relationships differ inimportant ways. One of the most important of these differences isthat the normative pressure for exclusivity is stronger in romanticThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.

In most societ-
ies, the general expectation is that people will have only oneromantic partner at a time, whereas there are no such expectationsfor nonromantic friendships. By extension, the consequences ofmaximizing in terms of romantic relationships are more seriouscompared with the consequence of maximizing for nonromanticrelationships because for romantic relationships the enjoyment orsatisfaction from a relationship comes from just one person. Incontrast, for nonromantic relationships enjoyment and satisfactioncan come from relationships with more than one person. Number of Choices as a Moderator of Relationships
Between Maximizing and Well-Being
The present studies also examined the possibility that the num-
ber of choices an individual has when selecting friends moderatesthe relationship between maximizing and well-being, such thatnegative relationships between maximizing and evaluations ofchosen alternatives will be stronger when there are more versuswhen there are fewer alternatives. As people make a decision thetendency to maximize entails searching through the availableoptions carefully, and after a decision has been made, maximizingincludes ruminating about unselected choices. An increase in thenumber of available choices necessarily leads to an increase in thenumber of unselected choices and in turn, is likely to be associatedwith an increase in the number of positive attributes of unselectedchoices."

that cortical reactivity is present at 8 months of age ininfants who later develop ASD. It remains to be estab-lished whether these responses are stable in early devel-

ABSTRACT
Gender studies have often been criticized for undermining family and religious
values. In this paper, we argue that these criticisms exhibit the characteristics of
conspiracy theories. We define gender conspiracy beliefs as convictions that
gender studies and gender-equality activists represent an ideology secretly
designed to harm traditional values and social arrangements. In two studies
conducted among Catholics in Poland (Study 1 N=1 0 1 9 ;S t u d y2 N=2 2 3 ) ,w e
examined the prevalence of gender conspiracy beliefs and their psychological
concomitants. We hypothesized that gender conspiracy beliefs should be asso-
ciated with a defensive identification with one ’s religious group, captured by
religious collective narcissism. In both studies, Catholic collective narcissism
was demonstrated to be a robust predictor of gender conspiracy beliefs .W e
additionally demonstrated that Catholic collective narcissism predicted out-
group hostility, and this effect was mediated by gender conspiracy beliefs .W e
discuss the implications for gender-based prejudice.ARTICLE HISTORY

“The ideology of gender presents a threat worse than Nazism and Communism combined. Protect
your children against gender, ”said Dariusz Oko, a Polish priest and a professor at the Pontifical
University of John Paul II, in a news channel interview (Graff, 2014 ; Graff & Korolczuk, 2017 ;
Sierakowski, 2014 ). His words reflected a broader conviction represented by some of the religious
officials that gender theory and gender studies (a transdisciplinary area of research that engages
critically with gender realities, norms, and identities, Brannon, 1999 ), represent an ideology (in
Polish referred to simply as “gender ”) that is a threat to the society. In an official 2013 letter of the
Polish Episcopacy bishops noted that: “for months gender ideology has been introduced into various
structures of social life ( …) without the knowledge or agreement of the society ”(Polish Episcopacy
Conference, 2013 ; para., p. 6), and called for “resistance against pressures from small, yet loud and
wealthy, groups who experiment on children and youth in the name of modern parenting ”(para. 9)."
10-1080_00224545-2019-1586637.pdf,religious* group,"The aim of the current research is to examine the prevalence
and correlates of gender conspiracy beliefs . Psychological and political research identified multiple factors that increase conspiracy beliefs (for
a review see Douglas, Sutton, & Cichocka, in press ). This work focused extensively on the role of
psychological threats and frustrations of individual needs. For example, conspiracy beliefs have been
linked to lack of personal control (Whitson & Galinsky, 2008 ), the need to reduce uncertainty
(Marchlewska, Cichocka, & Kossowska, 2017 ; van Prooijen & Jostmann, 2013 ; Whitson, Galinsky, &
Kay, 2015 ), powerlessness (Abalakina-Paap, Stephan, Craig, & Gregory, 1999 ; Jolley & Douglas,
2014 ), or threatened self-esteem (i.e., narcissism; Cichocka, Marchlewska, & Golec de Zavala, 2016a ). Other approaches emphasized the fact that conspiracy theories are usually seen as malevolent actions
of other groups , and suggested that group level factors might play an important role in shaping

Olechowski, 2015 ; Cichocka, Marchlewska, Golec de Zavala, & Olechowski, 2016 ; Kofta & S ędek,
2005 ;van Prooijen & van Lange, 2014 ; Zonis & Joseph, 1994 ). Given that gender conspiracy believers claim that their religious ingroup (i.e., the Catholic
Church) is threatened by conspiring enemy groups (i.e., supporters of gender studies), we assumed
thatgender conspiracy beliefs should be positively related to religious group identification that makes
ingroup members especially sensitive to outgroup threats. Such ingroup positivity is captured by the
concept of collective narcissism (Golec de Zavala, Cichocka, Eidelson, & Jayawickreme, 2009 ; for
a review see Cichocka, 2016 )—an exaggerated evaluation of the ingroup accompanied by
a conviction that others do not appreciate it enough. Prior studies demonstrated that collective
narcissism was positively related to perceiving even ambiguous intergroup situations as threatening
(Golec de Zavala et al., 2009 ). Such perceptions of threat drive the convictions that other groups have
malevolent intentions and conspire against the ingroup. Golec de Zavala and Cichocka ( 2012 )
demonstrated that national collective narcissism predicted the endorsement of conspiracy stereo-
types of Jews. In a similar vein, Cichocka, Marchlewska, et al., ( 2016b ) showed that national
collective narcissism was a robust predictor of a more general conviction that other national groups
are conspiring against one ’s national ingroup."

March 2013 (Tchorek , 2013). The comment made by the  former president of Poland and No bel 
Peace Prize winner followed  parliamentary debate on legal recognition of same -sex 
relationships. Although Wałę sa was castigated for “disgracing the Nobel Prize ” (Tchorek, 2013), 
his words were far from the most homopho bic opinion expressed by a Polish politician at the 
beginning of 2013. In her speech given in the Sejm ( the lower house of the Polish parliament) 
Krystyna Paw łowicz, an MP for right -wing party Law and Justice, said that homosexual 
relationships violate d the rules of nature and — as sinful and barren — could not  be facilitated 
by the state (Civil Unions Bills, 2013a). The debate on homosexual partnerships exposed the diversity of rationale against extending the 
civil rights of gay men and lesbians. While some opinions referred to the doctrine of the Catholic 
Church and underscored the pathological character of homosexual desire (Civil Unions Bills, 
2013a), other stressed the excessiveness of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) 
social movement claims and maintained that institutionalizing same-sex civil unions would 
diminish the prestige of heterosexual marriages (Civil Union Bills, 2013b). This dualism 
illustrates the distinction between two types of anti-homosexual prejudice – old- fashioned and 
modern homonegativity (Morrison & Morrison, 2002). Whereas the former is rooted in

3 traditional or religious beliefs and refers primarily to morality, the latter focuses on political 
demands of the LGBT organisations. The current research is intended to advance the reflection on modern and old-fashioned 
homonegativity in two ways. First, we aimed to extend the investigation of traditional and 
contemporary anti-homosexual prejudice to the non-English speaking context. The Polish 
adaptations of the Homonegativity Scale (Morrison, Parriag, & Morrison, 1999) and the Modern 
Homonegativity Scale (Morrison & Morrison, 2002) with parallel lesbian and gay men versions 
were developed within two studies."

when the global variability is taken into account. Whereas Morrison and Morrison (2009) 
contrasted American and Canadian samples, McDermott and Blair (2012) employed participants 
from the US, Canada, the UK and Ireland. Thus, both studies were based on the data collected in 
Western, Educated, Individualist, Rich, Democratic (WEIRD) countries, which are rather 
atypical cases in the global human population (Henrich, Heine, & Noren zayan, 2010). In order to 
establish the cultural universality of the distinction between modern and traditional 
homonegativity certainly more research results from other cultural contexts are needed. Attitudes toward gay men and lesbians in Poland  
The issue of homosexuality entered the Polish public debate after the systemic transition from 
communism to liberal democracy in 1989 and has become one of the most discussed topics since 
the beginning of 21st century. Its inclusion in the political agenda was associated with Poland ’s 
and nine other, mostly post-communist, countries ’ accession to the European Union in 2004 
(Graff, 2010). For the new member-states joining the EU entailed the acceptance of the non-

6 discrimination norms toward sexual minorities held by the Western European countries. These 
externally imposed standards evoked backlash against non-heterosexual individuals, which in 
Poland took form of prohibiting LGBT marches and blatantly homophobic comments made by 
leading politicians and representatives of the Catholic Church (Graff, 2010 ). Even though a decade has passed since Poland joined the EU, the discussion on the rights of gay 
men and lesbians is still heated. In 2013 the topic ’s presence in public debate was fueled by the 
debate on legal recognition of same-sex civil unions in the Sejm. Although several bills 
institutionalizing homosexual partnerships were discussed, none of them was adopted by the 
parliament."

comparative nationwide surveys (e.g. van den Akker, van der Ploeg, & Scheepers, 2013) indicate 
that the acceptance of homosexuality in Poland belongs to the lowest in the European Union. The 
prevalence of anti-homosexual prejudice is also demonstrated in domestic studies on 
representative samples (e.g. Antosz, 2012). Homophobic attitudes of the general public are 
echoed by the relatively high rate of LGBT individuals reporting discrimination on the ground of 
sexual orientation (European Agency for Fundamental Rights, 2013). The limitation of past quantitative research on attitudes toward homosexua lity in Poland is its 
unidimensionality. Most of these studies do not recognize various shades of sexual prejudice ."

direction of more tolerance since the beginning of the last decade. In
a recent CBOS poll (Feliksiak, 2017 ), 16% of respondents believed homo-
sexuality to be “normal. ”This percentage, however small, had tripled since
the 2001 poll. As many as 55% of Poles treat homosexuality as a deviation
from the norm, but one to be tolerated, while 24% agree that it is not normal
and not to be tolerated. Acceptance is more likely among those who person-
ally know a gay or lesbian person, those who are younger, better educated,
less engaged in religious practices, and living in bigger cities. It is also quite
conditional, as 53% of Poles declare no acceptance of same-sex civil union
legalization, and only 30% would allow for same-sex marriages. Only 11%
believe same-sex couples should be able to adopt children, and only 32%
agree that homosexual people can publicly demonstrate their way of living. As for where Poland ranks among other European countries, ILGA-
Europe, an independent, international, non-governmental umbrella organi-
zation advocating for human rights and equality, locates Poland very low in
their ranking of equality and non-discrimination (ILGA-Europe, 2019 ). The

analyzed. Those results are also confirmed by other sources showing high
rates of prejudice toward LGBT persons in Poland (e.g., van der Akker et al.,

show the same effect –Poland among countries with the most discrimination
laws and policies targeting LGBT individuals; however, there were some
differences (e.g., the amount of countries which were lower than Poland),

people, e.g. helping, altruism, courtesy and OCBO oriented towards an organization, e.g. civic
virtue ( Table 1 ). These theoretical assumptions were con ﬁrmed by Williams and Anderson ( 1991 )
who used a hierarchical regression analysis to distinguish the existence of the two behavioral
types: OCBI and OCBO. A common feature of all of the typologies is that they de ﬁne OCB as a group of behaviors, which
depend on the individual decisions of employees, and are not subject to the formal system of rewardsand do not fall into the set of regulated behaviors typical for a given position. A few authors have investigated OCB in a very wide range of di ﬀerent industries, such as: ﬁnancial
services, banking, insurance, education, services, retail, the food service industry non-pro ﬁt organiz-
ations, governments, military organizations, manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, health-
care and entertainment (Podsako ﬀ, Podsako ﬀ, Mackenzie, Maynes, & Spoelma, 2014 ). However, the
research included no samples from the IT sector. This is one of the main reasons why we wanted
to study and investigate the organizational behavior of a group of IT professionals. Most OCB research has been conducted internationally, with the majority of the samples being
from the US (61%), in addition to Australia, Canada, China, Germany, Hong Kong, Korea, Mexico, Por-tugal, Singapore, Spain, Taiwan, UK and Venezuela. To the best of our knowledge, there is little or no
research concerning the OCB of IT professionals from Poland. Furthermore, there were no examples of articles or reports from research on OCB in Poland, in con-
trast to studies of OCB in psychology and management in developed economies (Kowal & Keplinger,2015 )."

There is a need to update knowledge about the situation of female and male IT professionals in the
labor market; this naturally includes the IT industry. This need is con ﬁrmed by other authors, e.g. Robbins and Judge ( 2007 ). Our research is in response to this research gap regarding the organiz-
ational and individual aspects of behavior in the context of work and gender (Roztocki & Weistro ﬀer,
2015 ,2016 ). Other scholars have also pointed out the socially important role of gender. For example,
Mason ( 2000 ) emphasized that governments and societies should seek to eliminate gender inequal-
ities in order to promote social development. Gender di ﬀerences are important factors in the functioning of an organization. Such di ﬀerences
may be relevant in a variety of issues, including ethics and OCB and are likely to be important
factors in building organizational climate, job satisfaction and quality of life (Kowal & Roztocki,
2015 ). Gender inequalities are important issues that must be addressed in order to shape leadership
in an organization, its structure, strategy, culture, organizational climate, as well as personnel policy
(Stamarski & Hing, 2015 )."

ization ’s commitment towards gender, (2) integrating gender concerns eﬀ ectively into an organiz-
ation ’s agenda and policy, (3) creating equal opportunities and a conducive environment for
women and men in a workplace, and (4) promoting the equal representation and participation ofwomen in decision making at professional and administrative levels. Naturally, this policy providesfurther impetus for the study of gender issues. Equal opportunities for both genders have been changing at an undesirable pace. The Global

the German economy displayed much better performance in comparison to Poland."

transition economies, in comparison with developed economies (Keplinger et al., 2016 ; Kowal & Roz-
tocki, 2015 ; Roztocki & Weistro ﬀer,2016 ). However, very little is known about the e ﬀects of gender
diﬀerences on the OCB of IT professionals who work in transition economies in comparison with
those in developed economies (Keplinger et al., 2016 ; Kowal & Roztocki, 2015 ). Ethical issues
related to OCB, gender and country are important for socioeconomic development in both types
of economies. A clearer understanding of these issues may allow for better mutual cross-border econ-omic and socio-cultural cooperation. For this reason, this work focuses on the OCB of IT professionals
in the context of gender and country; posing the following question: ‘What are the links between
gender, country and OCB among IT professionals? ’The assumptions of our study are also relevant
in light of the recent Gender Policy ( 2016 ) in the European Union as mentioned in section 2.2. In this study, we deﬁ ned OCB according to Organ ( 1988 ); thus, OCB –an element of human capital
–is a form of individual behavior that is not directly recognized by the formal reward system and
plays a vital role in the e ﬀective functioning of the organization (Organ, 1988 ). OCB is an ethical
behavior associated with ethos, ethic, moral codes, value systems, principles and standards that
serve as the core elements of organizational culture. In our research on OCB, we focused on two dimensions (in accordance with Williams & Anderson,
1991 ): (1) individually-oriented Organizational Citizenship Behavior (OCBI) and (2) organizationally-
oriented Organizational Citizenship Behavior (OCBO). OCBI means behavior that is related tospeciﬁc individuals in an organization, such as courtesy and altruism. OCBO is behavior that leads
to organizational bene ﬁts, for instance conscientiousness, civic virtue, or sportsmanship."

exploratory in nature here. The sample of languages shows some imbalance. Indo-European languages dominate
the sample (13 out of the 17 languages), with half of the Indo-European group

Objective :An online intervention to improve fruit and vegetable (FV) intake
examines the role of planning, outcome expectancies, self-ef ﬁcacy and gender. Women are not only expected to eat more FV than men, but they are alsoexpected to be more responsive to nutritional advice and bene ﬁt more from
treatment. Method :A two-arm digital intervention with 269 men and 395 women
(M
age= 41.2, SD age= 11.45; range: 19 –66 years) was conducted in Italy,
Spain and Greece, followed up at three and six months, comparing a staticwith a dynamic, feedback-intensive platform. Results :Linear mixed models yielded an increase in FV consumption in both
the dynamic and the static intervention arms. In men, outcome expectancieswere positively related to follow-up FV intake."

were: non-perinatal HIV infection, presence of other
chronic somatic illness, problems limitingcooperation, special education, lack of caregiver ’s
consent, or inability to communicate in Polish and
led to the exclusion of four (out of recruited 60)
patients. Two control groups were formed. The ﬁrst, perina-
tally HIV-exposed but uninfected (PHEU), consistedof 24 healthy children and adolescents with HIV-infected mothers recruited from ex-patients of the
department and clients of non-governmental organiz-
ations. No siblings of PHIV+ subjects were tested.The second included 43 subjects with uninfected
parents and with no HIV-infected family members
(HIV-unexposed uninfected; HUU). Despite oureﬀorts, the demographic similarity of all groups
could not be attained. The recruitment of PHEU
group turned out to be particularly challenging, prob-
ably due to the HIV-related stigma. The analysisrevealed that PHIV+ children were signi ﬁcantly
older, more often raised by foster or adoption families,and their parents had shorter education when com-pared with both control groups ( Tables 1 and 2).Measures

used depending on the age of participants (5 –7, 8–12,

10-1080_09589236-2016-1234369.pdf,Union,"For example, Williams and Best (1982, 1990) measured gender stereotypes in 25 
countries through the use of the Adjective Check List. They reported that people of varying social status and from across different nations perceived women as interpersonally oriented, passive and 
weak. In comparison, men were seen as instrumentally oriented, assertive, active and strong. Williams, 
Satterwhite, and Best (1999) provide similar findings. The SCM has also been shown to generalize across 
different social groups, including the perception of Asian-Americans (Lin, Kwan, Cheung, & Fiske, 2005), 
Jews (Glick, 2002), the elderly (Cuddy, Norton, & Fiske, 2005), as well as Black and gay people (Fiske et 
al., 2002). It also generalizes across 15 European Union nations and 3 Asian countries (Cuddy, Fiske, & 
Glick, 2008). All of these studies included the United Kingdom and, in two instances, a South African 
sample. A Polish sample was not included in any of these studies. Yet additional research suggests the SCMs wide cross-national applicability (Cuddy et al., 2008; Fiske et al., 2006; Judd et al., 2005). On this basis it is predicted that the stereotype content hypothesis, as introduced above, will hold across all three countries. More specifically, the stereotype similarity hypothesis suggests that a preference for ‘paternalistic’ over ‘envious’ gender role portrayal strategies in advertising will emerge in the United 
Kingdom, Poland and South Africa."

Introduction
Emerging economies are countries or regions that are
moving from developing to developed status, to a free
market system, and toward a knowledge-based economy. Those emerging economies that resulted from the
breakup of the Soviet Union or represented the Eastern
Block are called transition economies (Kowal & Roztocki,
2013). Emerging economies have typically low standards
of living, a weak industrial and commercial base, and a
poor infrastructure. In contrast, advanced –developed
economies have a high level of gross domestic product
(GDP) per capita, as well as a very significant degree of
industrialization, commercial base, high standards of liv-
ing, and a well-developed infrastructure (Kowal &
Roztocki, 2013; Roztocki & Weistroffer, 2016). The progress of information and communication tech-
nology (ICT) forces constant training and upgrading of
professional qualifications, managing competencies and
innovativeness in information systems (IS) that leads to
human capital (HC) and economic growth development
(Kowal et al., 2016; Kowal & Roztocki, 2013;L u d w i g ,
Reuter, & Pipek, 2016). HC of the organization comprises
employees and their professional and psychosocial char-
acteristics such as knowledge, skills, social competencies,
behavior, and innovativeness (Kowal & Jasi ńska-Biliczak,
2016). HC development is a key element of knowledge-
based economy (Brockman & Roztocki, 2017)."
10-1080_10580530-2017-1366216.pdf,Union,"In line with our
model, the critical attitude toward globalization
expresses pro-social but critical (civic) involvement of
the subject, suggesting that it may render individuals of
a younger age particularly prone to adopting some of
the traditional values that are the basis of the normative
identity style (see Berry, 1997 ; Berzonsky, 2012 ). The
critical attitude may, therefore, reinforce people ’s ten-
dency to acquire information valuable for self-identifi-
cation as socially-involved individuals (predominance
of the informational style) and prevent them from
maintaining identity indifference (predominance of
the diffuse-avoidant style) (Berzonsky & Kuk, 2005 ). We predicted that the critical attitude toward globa-
lization would have a negative influence on both the
open (H.2.3) and overwhelmed (H.2.4) attitudes toward
the Internet. The findings showed that this attitude had
a negative influence on the open attitude only in young
adults, while having no such effect on the overwhelmed
attitude in either age group. The critical attitude may
create the need for seeking information and confirming
one ’s beliefs and intuition in an active way. The
Internet is a particularly convenient tool that young
people use to acquire information and verify their
beliefs which are opposed to globalization or, for
instance, to the European Union. Furthermore, the
Internet itself may be considered as a „proof ”confirm-
ing the individuals critical of globalization are, in fact,
right (Aboujaoude, 2011 ; Beck, 2006 ). As has been
demonstrated by a previous study (Senejko et al.,
2015 ), distance and selectivity toward the Web
increases with the individual ’s age and experience in
using it. Such findings are important for understandingthat older web-users are more demanding toward infor-
mational systems management compared to
adolescents. The findings only partially confirmed Hypothesis
H.3.2, as a positive influence of the critical attitude
toward globalization on quality of friendship was
found only in young adults. A still-developing critical
attitude and related commitment may see young adults
embracing close relations as a positive and community-
based aspect of functioning in a complex world."
10-1080_10803548-2016-1197577.pdf,Union,"A few possible 
interpretations of this pa radox include insufficient trai ning to operate complex 
machines, insufficient support from speci alist services and finally, excessive 
individual responsibility placed on workers for mistakes in operating these 
machines. • Ten most stressful work features include  both features related to job content 
(inevitably related to demands or characte ristics of the tasks, such as prolonged 
concentration and readiness to react qu ickly), work organization (excessive 
control, depending on the predecessors’ work) and company’s policy as regards the attitude towards employees (threateni ng with dismissal, lack of appreciation 
for initiatives, limited chances for pr omotion). The first type of work 
characteristics (the content) is difficult to change or to limit the risk of its occurrence. However, other types of work characteristics are modifiable 
according to the rules of psychosocial risk prevention. • “Risk of dismissal” is the most stressf ul work feature – almost all respondents 
indicated this situation as stressful. Th is feature is currently the most common 
stressor in the workplace in Poland and in other European Union countries. Thus, 
it does not result from the specificity of the Polish labor market. It seems that it will remain one of the leading problems in the coming years due to the economy’s changing domain from industry to servic e and sales and because of the switch 
from permanent employment to a contract system. To reduce the negative impact of uncertainty on employee well-bei ng, constant, formalized and open 
communication in this regard between management and employees is recommended. We also studied the relationships between th e stressfulness of work features, health and 
occupational functioning of the respondents. To  achieve this goal, we performed several 
correlation analyses including  broader categories of work  features (job content, 
workload/work schedule, control, organizational culture, relationships, career development, 
work-home interaction, responsibil ity) (Table 4) and including work features that were the 
most frequent and most stressful for the stud ied respondents (Table 5)."
10-1080_10803548-2016-1197577.pdf,Union,"Such a comparison makes it possible to set goals fo r each sector and to 
attempt to improve the distinctive areas. The chemicals sector had relatively high 
assessments. We also observed th e convergence of particular cate gories of assessments – their 
values were close to the mean for this sector. This can be a result of the high competitiveness 
in this particular sector – by its nature, the sector is very sensitive to current economic 
conditions. Nearly 70% of sales go to other economic sectors, wh ereas the rest goes directly 
to consumers – this industry is said to be working the hardest for the whole economy, what explains the high pressure put on the competitiveness in this  sector. [31] Compared to 
European Union countries, the productivity of  Polish workers in the chemical industry 
(including income) is – after Lithuania – the highest; at the same time, average personnel 
costs are one of the lowest. [32]  Thus, the gradual, systematic increase in the productivity of 
workers in this sector is surprising [1] consid ering that Polish chemical companies are known 
not to follow market trends and lack investment in new technologies and products. [33] The increase in competitiveness and goal-oriented att itude could have resulted in the increase in 
mental strain. Repeating the studies would ma ke it possible to assess whether the state of 
increased mental strain is t ypical for a particular  level of technological advancement or 
whether it resulted from the demand for sudde n adaptation to changes introduced to increase 
efficiency. In the mining sector, in turn, we observe d distinctive results in the category of 
interpersonal relationships. This results from the specificity of the job where operators work in isolation, create closed worker groups with strong bonds due to the surrounding natural and technical hazards."

the light of the theory,  people look for work environments t hat are compatible with their 558 
preferred values, goals and personality traits. The factors that draw  employees with high 559

for people with high DT at least in two ways. First and foremost, high autonomy and freedom 562

An overview of the most important theoretical approaches
[13,21] and deﬁnitions of bullying [10– 12] allows us to
distinguish fundamental, repetitive bullying deﬁnitionalcriteria, which include [ 14,15]: the regularity, persistency
and length of the employee’s exposure to a range of nega-tive behaviours; the imbalance between the target and theperpetrator; the inability of the targets to defend them-
selves; and negative psychological bullying consequences. As bullying is a heterogenic, interactional and complexphenomenon [ 22,23] and many of the bullying behaviours
have a covert, obscured, manipulative or contextual char-acter [ 24], it is diﬃcult to externally observe and assess
[25]. Thus, bullying research and the measurement of bul-
lying is most often based on the targets’ accounts andself-reporting surveys and questionnaires [ 26,27 ]. The sim-
plest and quickest to apply, although the most biased,
are those based on the respondent’s overall feeling of
being victimized by bullying (either with reference to agiven bullying deﬁnition [ 28,29 ] or without any preceding
deﬁnition [ 30,31 ]). These are referred to as ‘self-labelling
methods’ [ 15,p.150]. Despite the numerous weaknesses of
such a methodology and the ambiguous results that it pro-
vides [ 20,32], this kind of approach was probably one of
the most frequently used in bullying research [ 15,p.151],
even in studies sponsored by the European Union, such as
the European working conditions survey [ 33]. Next, there
are the ‘behavioural experience methods’, usually ques-
tionnaires which measure the respondents’ perception of
exposure to a number of given negative behaviours con-sidered to be bullying indicators. Nielsen et al. [ 15] have
presented an overview of as many as 27 diﬀerent invento-ries developed worldwide for assessing employees’ expo-sure to various bullying behaviours. Nevertheless, as the
authors of that overview noticed, most of these instruments
have an unknown theoretical background and question-able and unexplored psychometric properties. Moreover,
some of these methods seem to measure other phenom-
ena similar to workplace bullying, some were used onlyonce and have not been tested or developed, and only a few
have been tested and employed in numerous bullying stud-
ies, [15]: the Leymann inventory of psychological terror
(LIPT) [ 11,34], the negative acts questionnaire (NAQ) and
its revised version (NAQ-R), developed by Einarsen et al."

for men with children is 8.7 percent higher than that of those who are childless. Inequal-
ities in the labour market are thus strongly connected with inequalities in the division of
domestic work (Miko łajczak & Pietrzak, 2015 ; Olsson, 2012 ). Although men are more
engaged in household and parental duties than those in the previous generations
(Brandth & Kvande, 1998 ; Doucet, 2006 ; Fahlén, 2014 ; Gallo & Scrinzi, 2016 ; Ranson,
2015 ; Ruspini & Crespi, 2016 ; Sikorska 2019 ; Suwada, 2017 ), they still lag well behind
women when it comes to the amount of time they devote to the household (Kosa-kowska-Berezecka et al., 2018b ; Olsson, 2012 ). This gender gap in time spent of domestic
duties is observed in di ﬀerent European countries, from Italy (Gallo & Scrinzi, 2016 ),
United Kingdom, Poland, Germany, Austria (Ruspini & Crespi, 2016 ), or Sweden
(Suwada, 2017 ) and in European comparative perspective studies (Fahlén, 2014 ; Olsson,
2012 ). Studies conducted in Scandinavian countries show, that the involvement of men in par-
ental and domestic duties can be shaped and encouraged by the state (Haas & Hwang,2007 ; Rush, 2015 ; Singley & Hynes, 2005 ; Suwada, 2015 ,2017 ;Żadkowska, Kosa-
kowska-Berezecka, & Ryndyk, 2018 ). Both European Union reports and a substantial body of research and literature indicate
that men ’s greater involvement in domestic responsibilities and childcare is beneﬁ cial to
women ’s career development and has a positive e ﬀect on men ’s health and their children ’s
social, emotional and cognitive functioning (cf. Bartlett, 2004 ; Eurostat, 2017 ; Richter,
2006 ). Yet, little research has been focused on political, cultural and psychological
factors that actually help in increasing men ’s involvement in the household (cf. Cha &
Thebaud, 2009 ; Croft, Schmader, & Block, 2015 ; Kosakowska-Berezecka et al., 2016a ). In our paper, we focus on the role of welfare state (study 1) and psychological factors relat-
ing to smooth acculturation process (study 2) in fostering gender-egalitarian practices
among
dual-career couples. The role of welfare state in fostering gender-egalitarian practices within
households
According to Bühlmann, Elcheroth, and Tettamanti ( 2010 ) the type of capitalism present
in the country of current residence has a signi ﬁcant impact on the practices, attitudes and
values visible within couples and families."

meaningful experiences with the natural environment can motivate and re-direct human behav-iors toward nature and biodiversity protection, because of strong co-occurring emotions. Viningand Merrick ( 2012 ) identify several kinds of extraordinary nature experiences capable of generat-
ing changes in responsible behaviors toward the environment. For example, they describe expe-riences with nature mediated by books: ‘And it was just the most eye-opening life-changing
book that I ’ve ever read. It just..to realize that there were pesticides being used that would per-
sist on the earth for way beyond my lifetime and do horrible things, killing indiscriminately. ’
(intellectual epiphany, Vining and Merrick 2012 , p. 499). They otherwise describe experiences in
which the individual was overwhelmed by the sense of union and connection with the surround-
ing, such as in the following: ‘And that was probably the first time I had ever experienced the
powerful impact of something I have a hard time putting into words …but just kind of this iden-
tity…not just with the physical nature of the world but with everything [...] ..once again, my
experience was a union with everything that is, not just the water, not just the surroundings,but everything that is ’(connectedness epiphany, Vining and Merrick 2012 , p. 498). Regarding more ordinary environmental experiences, studies focusing on environmental acti-
vists have found that experiences in nature during childhood were essential in shaping the life
trajectories of environmental activists (e.g. Horwitz 1996 ; Kals, Schumacher, and Montada 1999 ;
Matsuba and Pratt 2013 ). Specifically, respondents attribute their environmental interests and/or
actions to a similar set of sources: time spent outdoors in natural areas during their childhood,influence of parents or other family members, influence of teachers or classes, involvement inenvironmental organizations, books, as well as the loss or degradation of a valued place (Chawla1999 ; Hsu 2009 ; Tanner 1980 ). Moreover, activities such as hiking, camping, hunting, or picking
flowers or fruits or vegetables have been found positively correlated to positive attitudes andbehaviors toward the environment during adulthood (Asah et al. 2018 ; Wells and Lekies 2006 )."

Participants were asked to indicate the frequency with which they purchased 20 listedfish and seafood products during the last year by using a 5-point scale (1 ¼‘never ’,5¼‘very

Church also exerts a strong influence on public life; indeed,
being Catholic is a part of Italians ’cultural identity and
strongly conditions people ’s personal and social choices,
separately from Catholic doctrine [ 16]. Italian law allows
health care professionals to refuse to carry out activitiesspecific to abortion, on the grounds of conscientious objec-
tion. It has been estimated that about 70% of Italian
gynaecologists are conscientious objectors [ 17,18]. In
Greece and Italy, as in Poland, abortion is considered to bea mortal sin. However, despite the conflict with their reli-gious beliefs, some women still decide to terminate theirpregnancies for non-medical reasons [ 19]. Since joining the
European Union, and also thanks to the current position of
Pope Francis, Greek and Italian attitudes have evolved,such that individual needs now surpass religious dogmas
and personal ideals [ 15,19,20]. In a study conducted in
Bosnia and Herzegovina, however, 73.1% of respondents
did not agree with abortion, and only 13% were against
the intervention of the Church in abortion decisions, with
Catholics being the most restrictive group in this
regard [ 21]. A mechanism of grieving may be triggered by the
proper burial of the fetus [ 9]. However, in our study, most
women chose not to collect the body of the fetus for bur-
ial. In some countries, mothers are not informed about the
burial place of their fetus and are encouraged to perceive
abortion as the loss of a pregnancy rather than the loss of
a person [ 10,11]. The social context that strengthens the
message that abortion is a sin intensifies feelings of mater-
nal guilt and interferes with the stages of mourning, the
latter being necessary for healing [ 12,13]."

Introduction
New Polish migration within the European Union: a natural experiment in early
bilingualism
Following the European Union ’s 2004 accession treaty, the UK, Ireland and Sweden opened up their
labour markets to Polish citizens without a transition period, unlike other member states. As a result,
the main ﬂow of Polish emigration concentrated in these three countries and especially in the UK,
which offered the largest labour possibilities. In 2011, about 611,000 long-term temporary immi-
grants were living in the UK, with most of them staying there for at least a year (Okólski and Salt
2014 ). The Polish immigrant population in the UK is young (20 –34 years) and well educated, with
most individuals coming from urban areas (Okólski and Salt 2014 ). Polish immigrants are usually
employed in lower skilled jobs, but usually show a tendency to proceed to better ones. Over two-

of these children is dominated by the languages spoken at home. Particularly at this age, the familymay be the only source of Polish exposure since most complementary schools enrol children from the
age of 5. On the other hand, regular contact with English during these early years may be limited tooverhearing or learning it from bilingual parents in an erratic fashion that involves substantial
language mixing. The latter may hinder children ’s vocabulary development (Byers-Heinlein and
Werker 2013 ). In this paper, we examine not only the expressive vocabularies of Polish immigrant children (in
Polish and English) but also their exposure to Polish and English before the age of three years to
assess its impact on vocabulary. The case of Polish –English immigrant children living in the UK
and Ireland might serve as an example of a more general immigration trend in the European
Union that is leading to a situation whereby many children are raised bilingually with different
languages spoken at home and in the wider society. Specifying early bilingualism in Polish immigrant children
Even though the population of new Polish immigrants is large and growing (ONS 2014 ), little is
known about Polish language acquisition for children raised in these circumstances. In particular,it is not clear what the exact language status of this group is. Is language acquisition bilingualfrom birth, and can it be considered as Bilingual First Language Acquisition (BFLA) (De Houwer
2009 ), even though exposure to family and ambient languages is probably highly unbalanced? De
Houwer ( 2009 ) lists three learning contexts for the acquisition of language before the age of six:
Monolingual, BFLA (regular input in both languages from birth) and Early Second Language(regular input in the second language (L2) from the age of 18 to 48 months). By ‘regular input ’,D e
Houwer ( 2009 ) means ‘daily or almost daily contact with a language through interaction or overhear-
ing a language ’(4)."

citation method (e.g. Altman et al. 2016 ; Bohnacker 2016 ; Rodina 2016 ), they did not compare narra-
tives elicited with and without a prior model, especially with regard to both the macrostructure and
microstructure of narratives. Our large-scale study aims to fill this gap by investigating the effects for
story retellings in the two languages of bilinguals in the previously unstudied language combination
of Polish and English. The current study
Although narrative production in Polish monolinguals is well-researched (Bokus 1991 ,2004 ; Shugar,
Bokus, and Smogorzewska 2013 ), so far, there have been no studies examining the development of
narrative abilities involving Polish-speaking bilingual children. This is due to the fact that widespread
child bilingualism with Polish is a relatively new phenomenon connected with migration events that
took place after Poland joined the European Union in 2004 (Haman et al. 2014 ). The Polish community
in the UK has now reached one million, and each year c.a. 25,000 children are born to UK resident
Polish families (ONS, Office for National Statistics 2014 ). The research on various aspects of language
development of Polish-speaking bilingual children is relatively new (e.g. Tamburelli et al."

Participants
The participants were 49 Polish undergraduate (BA-level) students of Italian (M age= 21.65,
SD = 1.70, range = 19-26; 41 females), who volunteered to take part in the study. One
person who was a Polish-Italian bilingual was excluded from the initial sample. Twenty-two participants were in their ﬁrst year, 14 were in the second year, and 13 were in the
third year of an undergraduate programme in Italian studies at one of the universities
in Warsaw, Poland. As the study took place at the end of spring term, at the time ofINTERNATIONAL JOURN AL OF MULTILINGUALISM 7data collection even the ﬁrst year students had already gone through at least seven
months of intensive courses in Italian as a foreign language. During their 1st year, students
received 10 h of Italian tuition a week, in year two, the 10-hour weekly tuition was com-plemented by the majority of lectures being delivered in Italian, and in year three, there
were seven hours of Italian language courses a week and all the lectures were delivered
in Italian (see the Results section for pro ﬁciency scores in L3 Italian and L2 English). Due to the language policy in Poland (and in the European Union), at the university
level it would be impossible to ﬁnd a sample that does not know any other languages
apart from Polish and English. Since knowledge of other languages might be a confound
in the study, in the background questionnaire we asked the participants to enumerate andself-rate their language knowledge on a A1-C2 CEFR scale (beginner-pro ﬁcient). Forty-
eight participants declared intermediate to advanced knowledge (i.e. B1 –C1) of
English as the L2. They also reported having learned German (12 students), French (6),Korean (1), Spanish (8), Portuguese (2), Russian (6), Swedish (1), Latin (1) and Greek (1). In the vast majority of cases, self-reported knowledge of languages other than English
and Italian ranged from A1 to B1."
10-1080_15298868-2016-1216008.pdf,Union,"Commitments were usually made for prolonged 
periods of time, or for an entire lifetime, as many people worked in one occupation, or even in one company, all their lives. Marital commitments also used to be relatively stable. In 
contrast, today we witness deregulation of life course with both exploration and commitment 
occurring at different stages of people’s lives. Researchers have observed significant social developments and new phenomena, such as rapid technological progress and novel forms of interpersonal relations, which disrupt the normative structure of the life cycle in Western 
societies (see Trempała, 2004; Wrosch & Freund, 2001). Now, people often retrain and change 
jobs multiple times. Similar volatility characterizes other traditional domains of identity, such 
as marriage or civil union, religion, and ideology (e.g., Brown et al., 2002; Pinquart & 
Silbereisen, 2005 ). To sum it up, while exploration has always entailed evaluation of different 
options, today commitment appears to be much less stable than in 1966, when Marcia 
introduced that construct to psychology. In our opinion, both exploration and commitment 
require redefining in light of current knowledge and social circumstances. The personality aspect of Marcia’s categories
The other problem is the position of exploration and commitment in contemporary psycho -
logical knowledge, especially in the context of psychology of personality and individual differences. This issue is present both in theoretical works and empirical studies concerning identity formation (Clancy & Dollinger, 1993; Dollinger & Clancy Dollinger, 1997; Lilgendahl, 
2015; Luyckx et al., 2014). Furthermore, it should be noted that identity formation constructs 
are now quite frequently interpreted in terms of personality dimensions."

of our research are limited to general tendencies and are the first step in looking for person-ality underpinnings of systematically defined identity formation modes in CIFM. In future, it would be worthwhile in considering the relationships with emphasis on interindividual differences in line with the person-centered approach. Disclosure statement

a problem or area that the negative events concern (issue similarity). Take, 
for example, the issue of changes in the tax system, such as the simultaneous 
abolition of the tax relief on Internet charges and of the family tax 
concessions. Should this be the case, the similarity is rather external and 
content-oriented. Thus, the way in which negative events come together results mainly 
from the manner of their perception by voters. The focus on voters or citizens 
is, however, at the heart of market orientation in political marketing. Kotler and Kotler ( 1999
) observe that to be successful candidates have to under -
stand their markets—that is, the voters and their basic needs and aspirations—and the constituencies that the candidates represent or seek 
to represent."

among the surveyed segments of voters were transformed in such a way as to 
allow for multidimensional scaling (MDS) to draw up a mental preference 
map (Shepard 1961; Wilkes 1977). With this end in view, all possible pairs 
of the seven reforms were put together, whereby in each pair, the reforms were supported to a varying degree. It can therefore be assumed that that 
reform was endorsed in a given pair whose degree of support was greater. By contrast, the difference in the degree of support for the reforms in each 
pair determined the strength of preference for the chosen reform in the pair."

one package. Their bundling can be effective in a persuasive message 
targeted at progovernment voters because all the correlations between these reforms are statistically significant. However, in the case of opposition voters, 
only reforms R1 and R5 are correlated. Consequently, in a persuasive 
message to this segment, only these two reforms should be grouped together 
to ensure the effect resulting from the combination of negative events 
according to the prospect theory. CLOSING REMARKS 
The research on the creation of persuasive messages conveying negative 
information extend the psychological prospect theory, according to which 
smaller losses are suffered when negative events are presented together 
rather than separately. The principle of integrating losses applied in the 
control of economic behavior actually influences the feeling of a smaller loss, however, applies directly to finance where financial loss can be measured 
objectively (Thaler and Johnson 1990; Thaler 1999)."

of the Polish national movement and its methods of ﬁghting for state inde-
pendence (Snyder 2003 ). When Galicia and Volynia became part of indepen-
dent Poland after 1918, the assimilation policy of the Polish government only
strengthened nationalistic feelings among the Ukrainian population. Diﬀerent developments took place in the territories of Central and Eastern
Ukraine. The lands to the left of the Dnipro were subject to a much longer
period of Russi ﬁcation than territories located on the right bank, the latter2 M. LEWICKA AND B. IWA ŃCZAKbeing for 200 years a part of the Polish Republic and Polish-Lithuanian
Commonwealth. Central Ukraine was the cradle of the Kievan Rus until the
twelfth century and of the Cossack ’s state in the seventeenth century, whereas
the eastern and southern lands and Crimea ( “New Russia ”) were not ethnically
Ukrainian. In contrast to Western Ukraine, in the territories annexed to Russia
and later the Soviet Union, the Ukrainian language was considered a Russian
dialect and was banned as a literary language. Russian literature and culture
were held in high esteem and were considered more sophisticated than the
“peasant ”Ukrainian folk culture. Whereas in Western Ukraine, the Polish-
Ukrainian con ﬂict was prominent, in the central and eastern parts awareness
of the con ﬂict between the dominated (Ukrainian) and the dominant (Russian),
ethnic groups was less pronounced. Dissemination of information was weaker. Whereas in Galicia, there were 52 Ukrainian journals, there were only 17
Ukrainian titles in Central and Eastern Ukraine (Hroch 2003 ). General illiteracy
(90% of the Ukrainian population was illiterate) and forced resettlement of
people in the Soviet period, contributed to weaker social ties and thus less
group integrity (Brown 2005 )."
10-1080_15387216-2019-1574434.pdf,Union,"It is obvious that the
similarities between the regions and between the di ﬀerent time periods within
Ukraine are greater than the di ﬀerences. The major limitation of the data presented here is the simplicity of the
employed identity measure used as the basis of analyses. Since we tried to
cover as many identi ﬁcations as possible, the best solution was to use a simple
list with one item per one identity target. Nevertheless, the identity scale has
not covered all targets that could be relevant in the studied area. For example,
we have not included Soviet identity, assuming that it is probably strongly
correlated with Russian identity on one hand and with the East-Slavic identity,
on the other. Given the 25 years that have passed since the dissolution of the
Soviet Union, it seemed plausible that the Soviet identity has lost its attraction
to the majority of the population and was replaced by other transnational
identi ﬁcations, such as the mythical East-Slavic community. The existent sur-
veys indeed show that the Soviet identity nowadays is typically found mostly
in the older population and is relatively low even in the easternmost regions of
the country, amounting to only several percent (4.3% in the east/south and
2.4% in Donbas according to the 2014 study cited by Kulyk 2016 ). Somewhat
higher scores were found in a survey carried out by Rejting (August 2018), with
11% in the south and 13% in Donbas. These di ﬀerences may be attributed to
various reasons, one being the lack of “Russian ”identi ﬁcation as a choice in
this 2018 study (the “Soviet ”identity could therefore incorporate both the
Russian and Soviet identi ﬁcations). On the other hand, the permanence of the
historical mental divisions on the territory of Ukraine (Katchanovski 2006 ,2014 )
makes one wonder whether future studies should not also include the Soviet
identi ﬁcation and its relationship to the other identi ﬁcations into the list of
identity targets. More attention should also be paid to the content and internal
structure of the national identity itself, its ethnic vs. civic or its “patriotic ”vs."

Background
According to the World Health Organization over 800,000 people complete1suicide every
year (1.8% of total mortality) and it is estimated that 1.5 million of people will die by suicide
in 2020. Poland ranks 4th highest European country for male suicide (16th of 172 countriesall over the world). The suicide rate among men in Poland is 68% higher than the average
rate in European Union countries (Wojtyniak, Gory ński, & Moskalewicz, 2012 ). The male/
female ratio of suicides is approximately 7.5:1 and it is on the rise. Potential fathers,
men aged 25– 65 complete well over half of all suicides. Each of these suicide deaths
will affect at least 6 (Shneidman, 1969 ) to 10 (Jordan & McMenamy, 2004 ) or even 20
people (Berman, 2011 ). A significant part of those affected are children survivors of par-
ental suicide deaths. In our article we aim to discuss their discursively constructed percep-
tions of their deceased fathers."

between the level of the autonomy of the device, its poten -
tial to execute independent learned actions that influence 
the well-being of the human, and the potential level of 
mental clarity required to navigate the device. The introduc -
tion of robotic technologies for mentally vulnerable people 
should be legislated for HRI for the following reasons: they 
have the possibility and capability to enter into legal interac -
tions; they operate autonomously (i.e., in such a way that 
particular legal actions, or more broadly, acts of law, do not 
result from an instruction by a natural person setting out the 
content of these legal actions); they operate beyond human 
control (or their function is checked retrospectively); they can 
adjust their actions in the legal sphere to their needs or intentions, regardless of whether these result from self- 
awareness (i.e., from the algorithm) [104]. These reasons 
highlight the need to regulate this situation in the sphere 
of civil law. In terms of civil legislation, first, there are questions of 
liability related to the concepts of strict liability or risk man -
agement approach, and questions of evaluation of those legal 
actions, which are contrary to morality [104]. There are differ -
ent regulations across the world for addressing that issue in 
civil code. One should note the first attempts by the European 
Union to develop a legal regulation for this issue. They 
include, first, the European Parliament resolution of 
16 February 2017, with recommendations to the Commission 
on Civil Law Rules on Robotics [105]. Currently, this distin -
guishes between robots intended for care, especially care of 
the elderly, disabled, and patients with dementia, and medical 
robots, e.g., those to be applied in high-precision surgical

principle, be proportional to the actual level of instructions

The upcoming demographic changes in the structure of 
society in developed countries and the shortcomings of 
healthcare services are the main impetus for an increase in 
the speed of development of safe and reliable robotic assis -
tance technologies for patients with neurological deficits. The group of progressive neurological diseases affecting 
motor and cognitive performance of patients represents the 
most challenging area for the introduction of multimodal 
robotic devices equipped with artificial intelligence able to 
adapt to the changing profile of cognitive and motor func -
tions of individual patients. The advances in technology are not fully paralleled by legal 
and ethical regulations, which provide instructions on how to 
introduce robotic devices safely and effectively into wide -
spread clinical practice, especially with regard to patients 
with brain diseases. Funding

of civil law liability. It also argues that the use of AI on a large

robotic technology designed for patients with dementia as 
a result of the recognition of the emerging burden of progres -

Introduction 
The neurovisceral integration model (Thayer et al., 2012) suggests that heart rate 
variability (HRV) should be treated as a complex i ndicator of brain activity rather than just a 
measure of heart function. This idea is s ubstantiated by numerous studies showing an 
association between HRV variables and cognit ive and emotional processes (e.g. Kreibig, 
2010). Further, prefrontal autonomic control has been demonstrated with a series electrical 
brain stimulation experiments on prefrontal area s to exert an impact on respiration, blood 
pressure and a number other autonomic contro lled functions (for a comprehensive review 
see Neafsey, 1990). HRV is claimed to index co rtico-subcortical apprai sal processes and has 
been linked with brain structures associat ed with threat perception including the 
ventromedial prefrontal cort ex, the anterior cingulate cortex, the putamen and the 
amygdala (Thayer et al., 2012). Low HRV has also  been hypothesized to be a biomarker of 
psychopathology - for example a population-based study found an association between 
illness onset HRV deregulation and depression prognosis after 10 years (Jandackova et al., 
2016). A recent meta-analysis considering thirty -four studies concluded that HRV reduction 
is a robust finding in people with schizophrenia and advanced this biological abnormality as a 
possible endophenotype of the illness (Clamor et  al., 2016). Large effect sizes  were found 
both for high frequency HRV (Hedges’ g=-0.98) and root mean square of successive interval 
differences (Hedges’ g=-0.91), thus indicating lower vagal activity in patients compared to 
controls. A common feature of mental health condition s is reduced social functioning. Recent 
research has started to link HRV deregulation to  poor social interactions."

transcendence is viewed as “an identification with everything conceived as essential” (Cloninger 
et al., 1993 ). It captures the degree to which an individual feels a part of nature and the universe at 
large. According to Cloninger’s model, higher scores of ST, along with high self-directedness and 
cooperativeness, are characteristics of more mature personalities (Smith et al., 2008 ). On the other 
hand, ST is often listed as one of the dimensional characteristics of schizotypy (Daneluzzo et al., 
2005 ), which is one of the risk factors for transition to psychosis (Mason et al., 2004 ). In its utmost 
form, self-transcendence may result in detachment from reality, similar to psychotic-like experiences 8
 D. MĘTEL ET AL.or psychotic states, especially in combination with low scores in self-directedness (SD) and coopera -
tiveness (C) (Daneluzzo et al., 2005 ). However, in our study, resilience was predicted by both higher 
levels of ST and SD, which may indicate that in this combination ST is experienced in a different, more 
healthy way as “acceptance, identification, or spiritual union with nature and its source”, as defined 
by Cloninger et al. (1993 ). Including depressive symptoms in the last step demonstrated that they were the strongest of all 
resilience predictors. Higher severity of depressive symptoms meant lower resilience, as has already 
been shown (Hjemdal et al., 2016 ; Wingo, Wrenn et al., 2010 ). Depressive symptoms did not 
eliminate the effect of cognitive and personality predictors of resilience, but modified it. Adding 
depressive symptoms underscored the importance of attention and processing speed for resilience, 
but it was the lower results that predicted higher resilience, which proves that a more at-ease 
attitude towards a task is also of importance."

The burden of trauma in Lithuania was largely influ-
enced by the political situation in Europe in the
twentieth century. Large-scale traumas associated
with the two World Wars, the Holocaust and the
prolonged Soviet occupation had a significant impact
on the Lithuanian population, marked with suffering
and oppression for several generations. Interest in
trauma and trauma research in Lithuania was started
soon after the collapse of the Soviet Union in the
1990s and several studies explored posttraumatic
effects of political violence in the country
(Kazlauskas & Zelviene, 2016 ). Survivors of traumatic events can seek treatment
for mental disorders in the public mental health care
system, which includes about 100 primary mental
health centres spread across the country, and in
more severe cases in psychiatric hospitals. Several
non-governmental organizations and crisis centres
in the biggest cities in Lithuania are providing help
for survivors of interpersonal violence, including psy-
chosocial support and psychotherapy. Additionally,
psychotherapists in private practice are also available
for trauma survivors. Despite these positive develop-
ments, care organizations for trauma survivors are
not developed in Lithuania and evidence-based
trauma-focused treatments for trauma survivors are
not available in the public mental health care system. Mental health professionals are increasingly aware
of the negative effects of trauma on individuals and
are interested in learning new ways to help trauma
survivors."

ABSTRACT
Background : Cognitive–behavioural studies among individuals suffering from post-traumatic 
stress disorder (PTSD) have highlighted attentional biases towards threats as a key factor in the 
maintenance of the disorder. Anxiety-related studies have hypothesized that attentional biases 
were due to attentional control difficulties in inhibition and flexibility of threatening 
information. Objective : Because it remains unclear how this theory could be applied to PTSD, this study 
aims to evaluate the inhibitory control and flexibility abilities of negative and threatening 
information in this population, using eye-tracking technology. Method : Fifteen adults with a history of physical assault and a current diagnosis of PTSD, and 
15 healthy control participants, completed an original mixed antisaccade task. Results : We found enhanced overt attentional allocation towards every item of emotional 
information among PTSD participants, such as indexed by the latencies of the first saccade in 
prosaccade trials, followed by disengagement difficulties, such as indexed by increased reac -
tion time to identify the target. Conclusion : Our results could represent empirical evidence of the general enhancement of 
attentional vigilance in people with PTSD in comparison with healthy controls, as well as 
specific inhibitory deficits."

vioural and ocular measures provided complementary 
information that allowed us to conclude that PTSD is 
associated with attentional control impairments and, 
specifically, inhibitory control deficits. Finally, peri-

this attentional control functioning in PTSD, by inter -
fering with top–down processes. Data availability statement

experience various degrees of these problems (Nash
et al., 2014 ; Colantonio & Comper, 2012 ; Hux,
Schneider, & Bennett, 2009 ) even several years postin-
jury (Jourdan et al., 2016 ). Disorders in these cogni-
tive domains typically include difficulties in focusing,
sustaining, and shifting attention, as well as acquisi-
tion, consolidation, and retrieval of information
(Backhaus, 2011 ). The most commonly used form of
treatment is cognitive training, which aims to either
restore function or to compensate for attentional and
memory deficiencies (Tate, 1997 ). Systematic reviews by Cappa et al. ( 2005 ), Cicerone
et al. ( 2011 ), the INCOG team (Velikonja et al., 2014 ),
and O ʼNeil-Pirozzi, Kennedy, and Sohlberg ( 2016 ) areconsistent in describing the most effective types of
intervention for mild memory disorders post TBI;
these include internal strategies training and the use
of external memory aids (such as notebooks, organiz-
ers, or prompting devices) by those with more severe
disorders. There is disagreement regarding the effect-
iveness of computer-based training for attention disor-
ders, with minimal support for decontextualized tasks. In contrast, metacognitive strategy training, focused
on functional everyday activities, is considered suffi-
ciently effective (Ponsford et al., 2014 ; Cicerone
et al., 2011 ). Considering the available scientific evidence, the
aforementioned interventions are highly recom-
mended for the rehabilitation of patients with post-
traumatic disorders of memory and attention. However, it should be remembered that their effects
are often small or moderate, especially if only
randomized controlled studies are considered (Elliott
& Parente, 2014 ; Rohling, Faust, Beverly, & Demakis,
2009 ). Observing the TBI population specifically, the
effect sizes obtained from single group studies can be
as high as 0.7 for memory treatment programs

of smell abilities with age  and in line with some previously published data (e.g., Dematte  et al., 2011) , 
we hypothesize that older participants will display lower odor awareness  also in the social context  (but 
see Croy, Buschhüter, Seo, Negoias, & Hummel, 2010) . Both low levels of  education  and material situation  can affect  personal hygiene  (Cleland and 
van Ginneken, 1988; Kuusela et al., 1997; Ilika and Obionu, 2002) . Because  odor awareness is related 
to behaviors such as avoidance of people with an unpleasant smell, paying attention to odorants or 
noticing other people’s sweat or breath  (Smeets et al., 2008) , people who are exposed  to strong, 
unpleasant social odorants in their everyday life  are likely to become accustomed and pay less 
attention to them. Consequently, they may score lower on measures of social odor awareness. As odor 
identification has b een shown to be influenced by education (Larsson, Nilsson, Olofsson, Nordin, 
2004 ; Liu, Wang, Lin, Lin, Fuh, Teng, 1995 ), it is likely that education alters also odor awareness  
through an indirect connection with olfactory acuity (Smeets et al., 2008) . On the other hand , people

 environmental pressures that promoted olfaction as a useful sense for hunting, fishing, gathering and 
horticulture. Yet, because our sample comprises mostly  industrialized societies where sense of smell is 
no longer used for hunting or foraging,  we hypothesize that better education and higher socio -
economic status will be positively correlated with social odor  awareness. Further, h igher e xposure to interpersonal odors  is likely to vary with subjectively preferred 
interpersonal distance , as detecting other people’s odor is related to closer contact  (Schleidt et al., 
1981; Ferdenzi et al., 2008) . Consequently, p eople  who feel more comfortable in personal or intimate 
contact  use their sense of smell more frequently and actively in the social context , which, in turn, 
makes them more likely to be odor -aware  than people who prefer greater interpersonal distance . Relatedly, they could often rely on odors during social judgements."
10-1093_poq_nfx048.pdf,Union,"Those high in national CN are likely to be mobilized by calls to restore the ingroup’s greatness because they fear that others do not recognize it—and because they may doubt its greatness themselves (Golec de Zavala et al. 2009). Collective narcissists are also likely to have been attracted to Donald Trump’s promises of aggressive action against targeted outgroups (e.g., Muslims), given that CN predicts hostility toward minorities (Golec de Zavala, Cichocka, and Bilewicz 2013). Results from other national contexts confirm that collective narcissists sup-
port political initiatives ostensibly aimed at countering threats from disliked outgroups. This has been evident in the context of the recent global resurgence of nationalist populism. For example, Britons high in national CN were more likely to vote in favor of leaving the European Union, a relationship that was mediated by perceptions of threat from foreign immigration (Golec de Zavala, Guerra, and Símão 2017). These findings suggest that CN may also predict support for Donald Trump’s candidacy. Nevertheless, research has not exam-ined the role of CN in support for Trump or nationalist/populist political fig-ures more generally. Thus, the present study represents an opportunity to look beyond CN as a predictor of intergroup attitudes and explore its relevance to candidate preferences. Specifically, it tests two hypotheses:
Hypothesis 1 :  National collective narcissism should predict respond-ents’ votes in the 2016 election, with those high in CN being more likely to prefer Trump. Hypothesis 2 :  National collective narcissism should predict respond-ents’ evaluations of Trump, with those high in CN evaluating Trump more positively and attributing more positive traits to Trump.Federico and Golec de Zavala Page 3 of 12

10-1097_jom-0000000000001226.pdf,Organiz,"Namely, it has been revealed that these fixed-term
workers have a higher work ability and exhibit higher levels of
work engagement and performance compared with manual fixed-
term workers. These effects are partially mediated by a high level of
PCF. Additionally, PCF has been shown to totally mediate the
relationship between higher SEP and good mental health of fixed-
term workers. Similar effects have been observed in general
population of workers who react ed to high PCF with affective
commitment, reduced turnover intentions, and better mental
health.49However, our study is the first to show that PCF is a
significant mediator between SEP a n dp h y s i c a lh e a l t h ,b o t hs e l f -
reported and confirmed by a medical doctor with WAI. Although
better work ability of non-manual workers compared with manual
workers has been consistently confirmed in the literature,50find-
ings show that even holding a manag erial position does not prevent
from a decline in work ability what further suggests the importance
of good psychosocial work conditions for maintaining work abil-
ity.51The recent evidence from 34 European countries confirms
this beneficial effect of good psychosocial work conditions on
workers’ psychological well-being and mental health.52,53How-
ever, having good working conditions seems particularly relevant
to the group of fixed-term workers as in their case it should
compensate employment insecurity and instability. In our study,
we showed that a high level of PCF ensures a ‘‘quality job’’ for
fixed-term workers, as it indicates a broad range of employers’
obligations which are of financia l and relational nature and more
importantly it also indicates a good match between what workers
expect from employers/organiz ations and what they are really
being offered. Contrarily, lower job quality and lower investments
on the part of employers have been listed as main risk factors for
temporary employment workers.5,19Among these investments,
trainings offered by an employer are commonly considered as
an important measure that enhanc es temporary worker’s employ-
ability.5,22,26,54,55C h a m b e le ta l56have shown that even blue-collar
temporary agency workers res pond reciprocally with higher
affective commitment when they consider that the training offered
by an employer facilitates their pos sibility of maintaining employ-
ment in the organization. Such opportunities seem also valuable forworkers who are more likely to accept their fixed-term contract as
they consider it as a stepping st one to a permanent employment. There seems to be a twofold explanation of our study’s main
conclusion that good physical and mental health and behaviors are
mainly accessible for fixed-term workers having higher SEP. On the
side of contextual factors, there is an absence of the policies that
enhance possibilities for development and employment opportuni-
ties for manual fixed-term workers on both national and organiza-
tional level.5,19,22,26,54On the personal side, the possible
explanation for this outcome is that workers with lower SEP have
poorer social and psychological capital, hence, poorer skills to
negotiate their PC with employers. Therefore, trainings for manual,
fixed-term workers who are deemed more vulnerable, could
enhance not only their employability but also proactivity and
self-management and subsequently improve their situation in the
labor market.5,19,57,58
LIMITATIONS
This cross-sectional study does not allow us to determine
whether being a manual fixed-term worker can result in poorer
physical and mental health and productivity or whether low health
and well-being, including a lower tendency for proactivity and self-
management, causes a worker to end up in lower quality temporary
employment. As the ’’healthy worker"" effect is strong in temporary
employment,59prospective studies should confirm our results."

1. Introduction
1.1 Food waste, a global issue
Food waste has become a global problem ( Buzby and Hyman, 2012 ;Gustavsson et al., 2011 ). It
is estimated that roughly 30 per cent of food is lost in the production process or wasted in
consumers ’households ( Gustavsson et al., 2011 ). Food is lost along the whole supply chain,
yet consumers are responsible for the most substantial portion of food waste in developed
countries ( Parfitt et al., 2010 ). Estimates of food losses and food wastage range from 158 to
298 kg per person in Europe and 194 –389 kg per person per year globally ( Corrado and Sala,
2018). In the European Union (EU-28), 53 per cent of all food waste is estimated to arise fromMoral

2016). The overall economic cost associated with food waste in Europe would amount to
about 143 billion euros per year, with almost two-thirds of this cost due to waste at the
household level. This high share of costs of food loss, compared to other sectors (e.g. production, retail), results from the high proportion of edible food being wasted and the costs
accumulating along the supply chain (e.g. processing, packaging, and retailing costs)
(Stenmarck et al., 2016 ). The extent of costs of wasting food at the household level suggests
that actions aimed at reducing household food waste might be especially beneficial."

for better job-fit solutions in the constantly chan ging world of work. This study highlights the importance of including c ultural aspects as job 
characteristics of great significance for improved recruitment procedures and employees’ 
work satisfaction. Both job demands and – in partic ular – job resources related to the 
cultural characteristics of the candidate or the em ployee may impact efficient work 
performance and productivity or unfavorable phenome na such as truancy, burnout, or low 
work satisfaction. For this reason, job analysis an d workplace descriptions require 
improvement and updating; the existing taxonomies s hould be extended to include the 
cultural dimension of the specific work environment  of a particular job position. This would 
contribute to the better and more adequate manageme nt of human resources and make for 
more conscious and efficient organizational culture  management at a very concrete job 
position level. The analysis of potential employees' capacities exp ressed in terms of cultural traits 
does not coincide with previous distinctions, as it  is based on a different theoretical 
background of job description paradigms and organiz ation culture theories. The cultural 
aspect of the job position opens a new perspective on workplace dimensions in recruitment, 
organizational change, and other human resource man agement challenges. The new 
approach requires an extended job position analysis  to contribute towards an increase in 
work-related well-being at the individual level, em erging not only from the cultural 
environment of the company but also from the concre te job position with its distinct culture. Downloaded by University of Canberra At 05:51 09 April 2018 (PT)

ences in the domain of expectations toward relationships that are prevalent in Poland and in the USA. The lack of assessment of expectations and attitudes toward relationships in both our samples makes this interpretation speculative and worthy of future research. The meaning of relationships as a source of pleasure or happiness or meaning in life may vary in Poland and in the USA. Adherence to various attitudes and beliefs toward relationships is, in turn, suggested to translate into various motives and acts within relationships (Watkins & Beckmeyer, 2020). For instance, Polish young adults in relation-ships in contrast to their U.S. peers might more strongly adhere to an eudemonic than hedonic view of relationships and perceive relationships as contributing to psychological well-being through self-ac-ceptance and personal growth (Keyes, 2002).28 |

ADAMCZYK et Al. Furthermore, in the Polish sample in Wave 1, only 3 individuals (1.30%) who had a partner were 
in a cohabitated union, whereas 154 individuals (64.30%) were engaged. This characteristic of Polish 
participants contrasts with the characteristics of the U.S. sample in which only 4 participants were engaged (1.20%) and 151 participants (43.60%) were in a cohabitating relationship. In light of these statistics, it is plausible to assume that the nature of young adults’ romantic involvement, characterized by predominance of romantic exploration and lower formal, binding commitments (see Watkins & Beckmeyer, 2020), may well illustrate the romantic involvement of young adults in the USA but not necessarily in Poland. Furthermore, because relationships may differently locate on the continuum of commitment (Kamp Dush & Amato, 2005), engaged relationships are perceived as a higher expres-sion of commitment, in comparison with cohabitation that is perceived as a more transitory relation-ship of lower levels of security and higher risk of relationship termination (Fitzpatrick et al., 2014). Because relationships characterized by more establishment and commitment (e.g. marriage) are con-sidered to be more beneficial than less-committed relationships (e.g."

As our study was conducted in Poland, to measure defensiveness we used the context ofrecent popular ﬁlms that depicted Polish mistreatment of Jews during and after WWII.Such ﬁlms (e.g., the 2012 ‘Aftermath’) tend to trigger defensive reactions in Poland, wherereminders of anti-Jewish crimes committed by Poles are often considered as ingroup-directed criticism, threatening to Polish national identity (Witkowska & Bilewicz, 2014). We operationalized image defense in terms of responses to such ﬁlms. Participants were

appeared and then asked to indicate their agreement on a scale from 1 =deﬁnitely

the survey was conducted. Ukraine is one of the largest countries neighbouring with
Poland and currently one of the largest immigration groups to this country perceived asdetrimental to the Polish society (Wenzel, 2004). Attitudes towards Ukrainians areaffected by the history of ethnic cleansing committed by Ukrainians on Polish populationof the Volhynia region during WWII.

cal image of the business in Poland is often created in order to “sell it well,” and that this kind of a public image has little to do with reality. Poland opened itself to international trade and to the exchange of labor force, for instance within the European Union, that is why it is important to understand Polish workers’ views on ethics and ethical practices, as it may be different or similar in different countries. There is evidence it happens similarly in American firms (Umphress et al., 2010). However, it can be noticed that Polish companies, which operate in more particularistic culture, favor UPB more than American firms and are more universalistic. In our research, the re ‐
lationships between UPB and the leader’s style of management or the degree of identification with the leader were left out, so further research in that area would be necessary using the Polish sample.

Under neoliberal social norms that reinforce individualistic goals, such as ma-

actions that promote social justice and challenge social inequalities might seem
surprising. If one additionally considers the fact that commitment to such causes
often requires a long-term investment of energy and resources and comes with
uncertain chances of success, such behavior seems to escape a simple cost–benefit
analysis. Solidarity movements, pro-environmental activism, and union activism,

to understand what motivates political participation despite such an unfavorable
social context. While past research on collective action predominantly focused
on frustrated needs as motivating factors (Gurr, 1970), in the present article, we
propose that people engage in collective actions because acting on behalf of valued
social causes gives them positive feelings of personal significance (Kruglanski,
Jasko, Chernikova, Dugas, & Webber, 2017). Therefore, instead of being driven
solely by grievances and a state of deprivation, we suggest that activists also en-
gage in actions for a cause because of what they psychologically gain from such
engagement. We describe this logic in detail next and we present six studies that
empirically tested this hypothesis. Activism as a Reaction to Negative Experiences
Seminal works by Gurr (1970), Runciman (1966), Merton (1957), and Pet-
tigrew (1967) set the foundations for a thesis that proposes people are more
motivated to engage in collective action when they experience a state of relative
deprivation."

Introduction
Second language (L2) learners encounter three types of words that differ in
terms of the extent of their formal and semantic similarity to their ﬁrst lan-
guage (L1): cognates, false-cognates, and non-cognates. Both cognates and
false cognates (also called false friends or interlingual homographs, see De
Groot, 2011; Otwinowska, 2015) bear formal orthographic similarity to their
corresponding L1 forms, but for cognates only does this similarity involve
shared meaning (e.g., Polish skalpel and English scalpel refer to the same con-
cept, whereas Polish lektura , “a reading”, and English lecture do not). Due to
their cross-linguistic similarity, the learning of cognates and false cognates is an
interesting object of study for psycholinguistic and second language acquisition
(SLA) research. In addition, understanding the extent to which the learning of
orthographic cognates can beneﬁt from explicit teaching is highly relevant to
instructed contexts, as addressed in the current study."
10-1111_lang-12390.pdf,Union,"1–47Otwinowska et al. Learning Cognates and Non-Cognates
Ringbom, 2007; Ringbom & Jarvis, 2009). In other words, researchers have
claimed that increasing learners’ awareness of cognates should be beneﬁcial
because learners will learn them faster, gaining vocabulary almost for free. As
Rubin (1987) noted, “once the student’ s attention is drawn to the relationship,
the same student may learn several hundred words in a very short time. Hence,
some kinds of conscious interventions are assumed to be helpful in the learning
process” (p. 16). Inspired by this idea, even entire multinational educational
programs sponsored by the European Union have been developed (Hufeisen &
Marx, 2007). Evaluating the hypothesis that awareness of cross-linguistic similarity sup-
ports vocabulary acquisition requires ﬁrst deﬁning awareness in relation to
cognateness. This has not been done in vocabulary learning literature at a suf-
ﬁciently detailed level in any of the above-mentioned studies and programs. For instance, Malabonga et al. (2008, p. 496) deﬁned cognate awareness as
the type of explicit knowledge that helps learners notice the similarity between
an unfamiliar item from one language and a familiar one from another lan-
guage. Still, this is rather vague when explicit knowledge and noticing are not
clearly deﬁned."

The results of this review and meta-analysis indicate that there might

clusion (Chester & DeWall, 2017; Leary, Twenge, & Quinlivan, 2006; Twenge, Baumeister, Tice, & 
Stucke, 2001; Twenge, Baumeister, DeWall, Ciarocco, & Bartels, 2007; Twenge, Baumeister, Tice, & Stucke, 2001). The effects of exclusion are more severe when exclusion is seen as perpetrated by a group rather than an individual, and especially when being excluded is attributed to one’s group membership (van Beest, Carter-Sowell, van Dijk, & Williams, 2012; Gaertner, Iuzzini, & O’Mara, 2008; Goodwin, Williams, & Carter-Sowell, 2010; Wirth & Williams, 2009). It has been postulated that groups excluded from intergroup interaction may radicalize towards 
violence as a means of attracting attention (Schaafsma & Williams, 2012). Since being ignored by other groups threatens the ingroup’s position, collective narcissists are likely to experience inter -
group exclusion as distressful and threatening and retaliate aggressively towards the excluding out -
groups. These expectations were supported by studies that explored the consequences of collective narcissism in the context of intergroup exclusion. Results of one study showed that Turkish collective narcissists held hostile attitudes towards the European Union because they perceived the Turkish delay to become a member of the EU (approximation of intergroup exclusion) as an insult to their group (Golec de Zavala et al., 2016). In experimental studies of intergroup exclusion, we used the adapted Cyberball paradigm to 
ask participants to observe a situation in which their ingroup is excluded (vs. included) by another group (Golec de Zavala et al., 2019b). Typically, in a Cyberball game, participants are led to believe that they play an online ball-tossing game with two other participants. In reality, avatars are pre -
programed to include or exclude participants (Williams & Jarvis, 2006). We adapted the Cyberball paradigm so participants could observe   their national team of three players play the ball-tossing 
game with a national, stereotypically nonthreatening outgroup. The ingroup was either included or excluded during the game."
10-1111_pops-12569.pdf,Union,"Together with results that indicate that collective narcissists are unable to forgive others for wrongs done to the ingroup (Golec de Zavala et al., 2009; Hamer, Penczek, & Bilewicz, 2018), such results link collective narcissism to revenge seeking in intergroup relations. Hypersensitivity to insult. Further evidence corroborates the conclusion that collective narcis-
sistic intergroup hostility may be subjectively justified as defensive. Findings indicate that collective narcissism is linked to intergroup hostility because it is associated with a perception of outgroups as provoking   retaliation by undermining the ingroup. Results of several studies converged to indicate 
that collective narcissists retaliated with direct or indirect hostility (in the form of schadenfreude) even in situations that require a stretch of the imagination to be perceived as an intentional, deliber -
ate provocation of the ingroup. For example, in Portugal, collective narcissists rejoiced in the possibility of an economic cri -
sis in Germany and preferred hostile actions against a German person because they felt offended that Germany’s position in the European Union was more appreciated than the Portugal’s position. Stretching the definition of provocation even further, in Poland, collective narcissists wanted to pun -
ish the producers of a movie ( Aftermath ) because the movie alluded to one of the least laudable mo -
ments in the national history: Polish anti-Semitism during the World War II. Another study showed that even after a transgression as petty as jokes made by a Polish celebrity actor about the country’s populist government, Polish collective narcissists threatened physical punishment to the actor and engaged in schadenfreude  , openly rejoicing in the misfortunes of their “offender.” They supported 
and cheered the politician who trolled the actor with offensive and hurtful remarks pertaining to, among other things, the actor’s father’s terminal illness (Golec de Zavala et al., 2016).54
Golec de Zavala et al. Thus, collective narcissism is related to a tendency to exaggerate the perception of insult to the 
ingroup’s image. Collective narcissists do not have a sense of humor as far as their ingroup is con -
cerned. They are disproportionately punitive in responding to what they perceive as insult to their 
ingroup even when the insult is debatable, not perceived by others, nor intended by another group."
10-1111_pops-12569.pdf,Union,"Collective Narcissism and Voting Behavior
Populism, Trump, and Brexit . Collective narcissism has been implicated in recent voting deci -
sions that profoundly changed the known political reality. American collective narcissism was the second, after partisanship, strongest correlate of voting for Donald Trump in the 2016 U.S. pres-idential election (Federico & Golec de Zavala, 2018; see also Marchlewska et al., 2018). Its role was compared to other factors such as economic dissatisfaction, authoritarianism, sexism, and ra-cial resentment that were mentioned while explaining the startling support for Trump’s candidacy. Collective narcissism was associated with the voters’ decision to support Donald Trump over and above those variables (Federico & Golec de Zavala, 2018). In the United Kingdom, collective nar -
cissism was associated with the vote to leave the European Union (Golec de Zavala et al., 2017; Marchlewska et al., 2018). Analyses indicated that the rejection of immigrants, perceived as a threat to economic superiority and the British way of life, were behind the association between collective narcissism and the Brexit vote (Golec de Zavala et al., 2017). In addition, collective narcissism was associated with support for the populist governments and its particular policies in Poland (Cislak, Wojcik, & Cichocka, 2018; Golec de Zavala, 2017; Marchlewska et al., 2018) and in Hungary (Lantos, 2019). In light of findings linking collective narcissism to intergroup hostility, it comes with little sur -
prise that the presidency of Donald Trump has seen a rapid increase in hate crime (Levin, Nolan, & Reitzel, 2018). In the United Kingdom, postreferendum increase in hate speech and discrimination against immigrants and foreign workers further supported the conclusion that the Brexit vote ex -
pressed xenophobic sentiments (Agerholm, 2016; Payton, 2016). Similarly, Poland (Flückiger, 2017; Sieradzka, 2016) and Hungary (Wallen, 2018) noted an unprecedented rise in xenophobia under their populist governments supported by collective narcissists."
10-1111_pops-12569.pdf,Union,"Importantly, the populist rhetoric emphasizes the division between the “chosen” or “true” members of the ingroup and their internal opposition and outgroups seen as threatening to the plan of the ingroup’s rebirth (Mudde, 2007; Muller, 2016; Sanders, Hurtado, & Zoragastua, 2017). Empirical evidence corroborates the expectation that uncertainty regarding personal signifi -
cance and exposure to populist rhetoric increases the tendency to hold collective narcissist belief about the ingroup. Results of a longitudinal study showed that the association between collective nar -
cissism and conspiratorial thinking increased during the Trump presidential campaign. As the cam -
paign evolved, the belief in conspiratorial explanation of political events that this campaign offered aplenty became more strongly associated with collective narcissism (Golec de Zavala & Federico, 2018). An experimental study showed that collective narcissism increased after an exposure to the populist narrative promoted by the Leave Campaign regarding the United Kingdom’s history ver -
sus a neutral short account of the United Kingdom’s modern history. After reading a paragraph commenting about the United Kingdom’s “compromised power” due to the long-term EU’s “strong influence” over British policy, participants reported higher levels of residual collective narcissism (without the positive overlap with ingroup identification) and higher support for Britain leaving the European Union (Marchlewska et al., 2018, Study 2). Political conservatism and neo-fascism . Another notable political association is the link be -
tween collective narcissists and political conservatism. In the United States, collective narcissism is positively associated with self-definition as politically conservative and a support for the Republican Party (Federico & Golec de Zavala, 2018). In Poland, collective narcissism is related to self-defi -
nition as conservative and right-wing as well as support for right-wing political parties. Collective narcissism explains variance in political conservatism and right-wing preference independently of right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation, robust predictors of political con -
servatism (Golec de Zavala & Mole, 2019)."

synergetic effects which would not have been possible when studying effects of each dimensions of 
family relations separately (Bergman, 2001). Family Solidarity Patterns 
Solidarity is a key feature of the union between family members that characterizes family 
relations and creates the context of individual development (Albert, Ferring, & Michels, 2013; 
Bengtson, 2001; Olson, 2000; Schwarz, Trommsdorff, Albert & Mayer, 2005). The solidarity 
model was developed in the context of adult child-parent relations and up to date, this framework 
was used to investigate intergenerational relations in a family in later stages of the human life-span 
with few exceptions (e.g., Attar-Schwartz, 2015; Michels, Albert, & Ferring, 2011). Bengtson and Schrader (1982) outlined six distinct dimensions defining intergenerational 
solidarity: associational (physical integration/isolation), structural (geographic proximity/distance), 
affectual (e.g. intimacy), consensual (e.g., agreement/dissent in values and norms between family 
members), functional (dependency/autonomy), and normative (familism) dimensions. Reports from 
children or from children and parents are used across studies to assess solidarity dimensions using 
different assessment tools (e.g., Attar-Schwartz, 2015; Belsky, Jaffee, Caspi, & Moffitt, 2003). Based on these dimensions and using various clustering methods (e.g., LCA, k-mean clustering, or 
dichotomization of data), different authors have found similar, yet not always identically labeled, 
clusters/patterns of families."

The questionnaire was built using a biopsychoso-cial model and contained five parts: sociodemographic data, professional factors, medical factors, physical factors and psychological factors. Physical factors were evaluated using a 5-point Likert scale and were summed, resulting in a range of 7–35, with higher values interpreted as inferior physical fitness. Psychological factors were evaluated in the last part of the questionnaire using the 5-point Likert scale and interpreted as ‘post-transplantational adapta-tion’."

10-1136_bmjopen-2019-033237.pdf,Union,"Homelessness prevalence was 4.96% for lifetime (95% CI 4.39% to 5.59%), 1.92% in the past 5 years (95% CI 1.57% to 2.33%) and 0.71% for the past year (95% CI 0.51% to 0.98%) and varied significantly between countries (pairwise comparison difference test, p<0.0001). Time spent homeless ranged between less than a week (21%) and more than a year (18%), with high contrasts between countries (p<0.0001). Male gender, age 45–54, lower secondary education, single status, unemployment and an urban environment were all independently strongly associated with lifetime homelessness (all OR >1.5).Conclusions
 The prevalence of homelessness among 
the sur
veyed nations is significantly higher than might be 
expected from point-
 in-
 time and homeless ser
vice use 
statistics. There was substantial variation in estimated prevalence across the eight nations. Coupled with the well-
 established health impacts of homelessness,
 medical 
professionals need to be aware of the increased health risks of those with experience of homelessness. These findings support policies aiming to improve health services for people exposed to homelessness.Intr ODuCtIOn
Recent decades have seen a marked rise in 
homelessness 
across Europe.1 Although there 
continues to be a lack of comparable informa-tion,
2 expert estimates from 2009 suggested 
that, each year, about 4.1 million people in the European Union were unsheltered, or in emergency or temporary accommodation. 3 
This growth in the number of people expe-riencing homelessness has encompassed an increased number of women, youth, families and migrants. 1 As an extreme expression of 
both poverty and inequality, homelessness has a significant impact on the health and well-
 being of individuals who experience 
homelessness.4 In addition, any period of 
homelessness has been shown to be an indi-cator of greater risk of various mental and physical health problems, including the phys-ical and mental stress of homelessness leading to the earlier experience of age-
 related 
health 
problems than among the general strengths and limitations of this study
 ►Current prevalence of homelessness in Europe is 
unknown, cross-
 na
tional and comparative data are 
scarce and measures of homelessness vary widely across Europe. ►The current study involves a large sample of European citizens from eight nations with widely varying health and social systems. ►The study used a relevant probability-  weighted a p-
proach to ensure the representativeness of the sam-ple, and included an extremely low rate of missing data. ►The survey was not able to build a pattern of cumu-lative periods of homelessness or to investigate how periods of homelessness related to unemployment or other forms of social stress."

ample description
Response rates were slightly better than expected, and 
ranged from 30.4% to 33.5%, resulting in a total number of 5631 respondents producing 5295 valid questionnaires. The majority of respondents were women (52% for the overall sample), except in the Netherlands (48.1%) and France (47.7%) (table
 
1). A majority of respondents were 
either married or in a civil union, most notably in Poland (71%) and Ireland (69%). At least 48% completed higher education. Respondents were mainly employed either full time or part time, except in Ireland (48%). Prevalence of homelessness
Overall pooled lifetime prevalence of homelessness as defined in this study was 4.96% (95% CI 4.39% to 5.59%), although there was significant variation between coun-tries (see table
 
2). Spain reported the highest lifetime 
prevalence with 12.6%, and Ireland had the lowest at 1.7%. Five-
 year prevalence was 1.92% (95% CI 1.57% to 
2.33%) across all countries, with the highest rates again in Spain at 6.2% and the lowest in Ireland at 0.4%."

recorded much higher figures than those produced by existing measures. 9 10 21 22 The average across our surveyed 
countries is less than recent studies for the USA, which recorded 4.2% lifetime prevalence of homelessness lasting at least 1 month,
10 and estimates from Toro et al of 6.1% 
for lifetime homelessness as measured in our survey. Our estimates are also similar to limited prior European data available. With an earlier community telephone survey (2001–2005), Toro et al found prevalence rates of 4.0% for Italy,
11 with our figure of 5.4% perhaps accounting for 
the recorded rise in homelessness in Italy over the past decade."

aggression, perpetration, victimization, self-control, adolescents, Poland
Aggressive perpetration refers to individual’s aggressive acts toward others 
and aggressive victimization refers to individual as target of being aggressed. Both perpetration and victimization can be displayed in physical (e.g., hit-ting, shoving, fighting), verbal (e.g., name calling, verbal abuse, insulting), and indirect (e.g., ignorance, social exclusion) forms (Österman & Björkqvist, 2008). Aggressive perpetration and victimization during adolescence is a salient public health problem that has attracted worldwide attention (Nieri, Matjasko, Williams, & Guerra, 2013), as they can cause various psychosocial problems hindering positive youth development, such as reduced self-esteem, increased internalizing and disruptive behaviors, increased suicidal ideation, and self-harm (Crick, 1996; Hay & Meldrum, 2010; Khatri, Kupersmidt, & Patterson, 2000; Prinstein, Boergers, & Vernberg, 2001). Cross-national differences in youth aggressive perpetration and victimiza-
tion are found, such that adolescents from Eastern European and Baltic coun-tries are more likely to perpetrate and be victimized compared with their Western European counterparts (Mercy, Butchart, Farrington, & Cerdá, 2002). Scholars have attributed the increased levels of perpetration and vic-timization among adolescents from these regions to the economic and politi-cal instability that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union, a special historical period when many social problems were unrecognized, underesti-mated, and unsolved (Craig et al., 2009; Sajkowska, 2010). The negative influence of such political and social changes on youth perpetration and vic-timization seems long lasting, as evidenced by the results of a recent large-scale survey showing that adolescents from these geographical areas still report substantial rates of perpetration and victimization (World Health Organization, 2014). These suggest that continuous investigation into related protective factors of perpetration and victimization among adolescents from Eastern European and Baltic countries are paramount. Given this background, the present research, based on the general theory of crime (Gottfredson & Hirschi, 1990), examined the association between attachment to parents and self-control with perpetration and victimization among Polish adolescents. Why Polish Adolescents? This study focused on Polish adolescents not only because of their Eastern European background but also out of both theoretical and practical concerns."

tion, and it is doubtful to what extent it can be considered gender-fair. To gain insights into the current use of the new combination form masculine + m/f in job advertisements, we explored its occurrence in comparison with other gender-fair forms. In line with Hypothesis 2, we expected the combination form to be more frequent in gender-typical branches (especially in the male-dominated branch) than in the gender-balanced branch (Hypothesis 4). Method
We analyzed online job advertisements from Switzerland, Austria, Poland, and the Czech Republic regarding the linguistic form of the job title. We included the following three branches: construc-tional steel and metal work (male-dominated, for example, locksmith, construction engineer), restau-rants and food services (gender-balanced, for example, waiter, sous-chef), and health care (female-dominated, for example, doctor, care worker). Available census data for these sectors docu-mented the gender distribution within each branch (European Union: Eurostat, 2012; Switzerland: Bundesamt für Statistik, 2012) and showed that the gender proportions were comparable in the countries under investigation. Furthermore, the selected branches were equally representative in the four countries, in that they comprised 2% to 7% of all employees in each country (Bundesamt für Statistik, 2012; Eurostat, 2012); all branches included low-status jobs as well as high-status jobs. Information on gender equality and gender distributions in the four countries is presented in Table 1. For the sampling of job advertisements, we used the job search engine Careerjet, which is 
available in all four countries (i.e., careerjet.ch, careerjet.at, careerjet.pl, and careerjet.cz). This search engine provides a list of all job advertisements published online and thus covers a large variety of job offers (43,240 job ads in Switzerland, 32,389 in Austria, 70,547 in Poland, and 51,216 in the Czech Republic at the time of our study). The use of the same webpage allowed for maximum comparability between countries."

Obviously, individuals need relationships and group memberships as they help to attain self-relevant goals and satisfy the need to belong (Baumeister & Leary, 1995). Relationships, however, are perceived as impermanent, and when the costs start to exceed the benefits, people are ready to leave them (Oyserman et al., 2002). In contrast, in collectivist societies (the majority of Asian, Latin American, and African coun-
tries), group membership is a central aspect of identity (Hofstede, 2001; Markus & Kitayama, 1991; Oyserman et al., 2002). As a result, people are strongly connected with their ingroup, and 4 Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology 00(0)
“we” takes precedent over “I” in people’s self-definitions (Triandis, 1995). In collectivist societ-
ies, people describe themselves in terms of their social roles and responsibilities rather than their individual qualities. Valued personal traits are those that lead to maintaining harmonious rela-tionships with close others, so people are inclined to subordinate their personal goals and priori-ties to the collective welfare and objectives of the community to which they belong. In individualist countries, people are more competitive and assertive, whereas in collectivist cultures, they are more willing to cooperate and avoid interpersonal conflicts (Cox, Loebel, & McCleod, 1991). Their group memberships are perceived as fixed and stable and an association to which people must accommodate rather than leave (Oyserman et al., 2002). The boundaries between ingroups and outgroups are firm and inflexible. The I-C dimension, although widely investigated, poses some empirical difficulties."
10-1177_0022022118784204.pdf,Union,"Highly salient group categories can lead to the dehumanization of outgroup members, perpetration of inhumanities, and collective violence (Hewstone, Rubin, & Willis, 2002; Leyens, Demoulin, Vaes, Gaunt, & Paladino, 2007). This kind of violence often takes place in the context of collectivist cultures in which social categories are more salient than they would be in an indi-vidualist culture. Wars, conflicts, riots, and revolutions occur more often in collectivist cultures than in individualist cultures. The analyses based on the Global Terrorism Database show that cultural tightness is a strong predictor of terrorist incidents (Gelfand, LaFree, Fahey, & Feinberg, 2013), whereas Basabe and Valencia (2007) provide evidence for positive correlation between collectivism and war. Collectivist culture might even be considered a risk factor for collective violence, ethnic conflicts, wars, and other extreme outcomes of ingroup bias (Oyserman & Lauffer, 2002). Most contemporary genocides were based on collectivist racism (e.g., the Holocaust, the massacre of Tutsi people in Rwanda), nationalism (Armenian genocide committed by Ottoman Turkey), or communism (Ukrainian famine in Stalin’s Soviet Union, Khmer Rouge’s genocide in Cambodia). Societal levels of happiness and psychological well-being may be lower in collectivist societies for objective reasons. Collectivist societies experience more wars and conflicts—which, in highly collectivist societies, can be expressions of ingroup bias—and these social factors may underlie the lower happiness observed in collectivist societies. We propose, therefore, that global differences in happiness are a result of ingroup bias and its 
consequences (expressed both in everyday interactions and more serious group conflicts), rather than of collectivism itself. As ingroup bias is a combination of “ingroup love” and “outgroup 6 Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology 00(0)
hate” (Brewer, 1999), it is crucial to measure both these aspects accurately. The first component 
of ingroup bias can be operationalized as ingroup favoritism—a preferential treatment of ingroup members compared with outgroup members (Tajfel & Turner, 1979)."
10-1177_0022022118784204.pdf,Fund,"In one part of the WVS questionnaires, participants received a list of nine groups (including people who have AIDS, homosexuals, and unmarried couples) and were asked to mention any that they would not like to have as neighbors. They received one point for each given group and two points for every group that they did not mention. We decided to exclude two items that measured attitudes toward (a) heavy drinkers and (b) drug addicts, due to low loadings (<.30) of the general factor. The final indicator was, thus, a sum of 7 items, with an internal consistency of α = .74 (as measured on an individual level in the full WVS database). The scale was reversed to obtain an indicator of generalized group-focused enmity. Control Variables
GDP per capita (indicator of national income) was taken from the World Economic Outlook Database provided by the National Monetary Fund. The dataset is available online at www.imf.org. For the present analyses, we used the October 2017 data release. As have many other authors (e.g., Meisenberg, 2012; Stolarski, Zajenkowski, & Meisenberg, 2013), we applied a logarithmic transformation because of the highly skewed and leptokurtic nature of GDP worldwide, which approximates to a normal distribution in the logarithmic form. Many variables correlate far better with logGDP than with untransformed GDP, probably due to the nonlinear impact of wealth on 
various outcomes (cf. Easterlin, 1974, 2005; see also Stolarski et al., 2013)."

The dimension consists of ﬁveitems (e.g., ‘‘Death is a natural aspect of life’’). Another dimension, ApproachAcceptance, reveals to what extent an individual has a belief in a happy afterlife. The celestial attitude reﬂects the power of belief (most often associated with
religiosity) that death is the transition to a new life. The dimension consists of10 items (e.g., ‘‘Death is a union with God and eternal bliss’’). The last of thedimensions, Escape Acceptance, represents the recognition of death as a betteralternative in the face of perceiving life as full of pain and suﬀering. This aspectof the attitudes toward death represents the lack or loss of eﬀective ways ofdealing with pain and problems of existence. The dimension consists of ﬁve items(e.g., ‘‘Death provides an escape from this terrible world’’). The DAP-R questionnaire is characterized by good psychometric properties.

The rationale forintroducing this covariance to the model may be that the rational and scien-
tiﬁc perception of death as an ultimate element of life (referred to in Item
14 and Item 24) may be accompanied by a speciﬁc aspect of fear of death(measured by Item 20 and Item 32)—the fear from the unknown (Neimeyer& Moore, 1994). In the next step (Model 3), another error correlation was taken into account,
this time from the measurement of the claims forming the Cluster 3 in theApproach Acceptance area of death (Item 15: ‘‘Death is union with God andeternal happiness,’’ Item 28: ‘‘The only thing that gives me relief in the face of
death is the faith in life after death,’’ and Item 4: ‘‘I believe that after death I will
be in heaven’’) and Cluster 1 of the subscales of Escape Acceptance (Item 11:‘‘Death is the deliverance from pain and suﬀering,’’ Item 23: ‘‘Death is therelease from earthly suﬀering,’’ and Item 9: ‘‘Death is the escape from thiscruel world’’). The content analysis of the positions building the structure ofthe distinguished clusters suggests that in the face of the experience of existenceso full of suﬀering, death can be seen as an escape from an unbearable temporallife to a better supernatural afterlife. As a result of the changes, the vast majority of adjustment measures have
reached values whose formal interpretation allows the model to be verywell matched to the data (CMIN/ df¼2.93; RMSEA ¼.061; SMRM ¼.039;
PCLOSE ¼.068; GFI ¼.96; CFI ¼.98; TLI ¼.96). The analyses thus suggest a
ﬁve-factor (postdimensional) structure of the attitudes toward death. They alsoconﬁrm the good psychometric properties of the DAP-R-PL questionnaire.Both Cronbach’s a(as reliability indicators) and model ﬁt scores in CFA (as
theoretical relevance indicators) proved to be high enough for the tool to be
successfully used in research. The ﬁnal model of the attitudes toward death is
presented in Figure 1.Table 6."
10-1177_0084672420926259.pdf,religious* group,"This is a complete novelty, showing that the classification in the DSM begins to accept the relativist stance (Triandis, 2007). Interestingly, this edition of the manual also mentions the previously ignored term ‘sub-culture’ 
(APA, 1980, pp. 163, 188, 269, 281, 333, 356) and the idea of countercultural life-style (p. 167). These terms appear in the context of substance use disorders, and seen from the meta-level, their presence seems to show the influence of the culture of the time on the contents of the manual. The sub-culture phenomenon, while defined by Milton M. Gordon much earlier (Gordon, 1947), gained social importance in the 1970s – sub-cultures became visible in the social space and could no longer be ignored. Religion is mentioned in DSM-III only when it offers a longer description of paranoid personality disorders, mentioning that the disorder is over-represented among mystical or esoteric religious group leaders, as well as pseudo-scientific and quasi-political groups (APA, 1980, p. 308) and as – by now the usual – marginal symptom in schizophrenic disorders (p. 182). However, expectation of religious revelations are listed as a factor intensifying the experience of Cannabis indica intoxication (p. 121), and mystical or religious experiences are described as the main ideas and fantasies of a patient suffering from hallucinogen hallucinosis (p. 154). It seems that those mentions of religion are no accident. Similarly, DSM-III lists non-traditional religious or mystical ideas as part of the symptom list for abusing certain psychoactive substances (p. 167). Religion, then, similarly to culture, appears in relation to the counterculture which grew strong at the time. The term ‘cultural and religious values’ appears in a rather unexpected context – the authors of the manual state that ‘illogical thinking’ is not psychopathologically important when resulting from cultural or religious values (APA, 1980, p. 361)."
10-1177_0084672421994199.pdf,Union,"Turn of the millennium and its first decade (2000 – 2012)
The first decade of the 21st century is a time of two main development directions for Polish psy-chology of religion: first, intense international activity, with a growing number of international publications and frequent participation in foreign conferences, and second, more works by psy-chologists not related either to the religious studies of Kraków or the Catholic institutions appear on the publishing market. European psychology of religion was also energized in the “noughties,” publication-, conference- and organization-wise (Belzen, 2002, 2004). Such initiatives came to Poland somewhat later, but given the work of the 1990s, Polish psychology of religion was ready 8 Archive for the Psychology of Religion 00(0)
for them. An analysis of PsychInfo and Google Scholar databases shows that between 2005 and 
2012 there was a large increase in indexed publications from Poland (Śliwak et al., 2017a, p. 14). There was an important event, which had to influence this international cooperation but also the overall public spirit and intellectual conditions, especially for young scientists, those who were students or postgraduates at the time. On the 1 May 2004, Poland joined the European Union, and the process was preceded by long preparations not only political, but also educational, aiming to support and promote the unity and integration of multicultural Europe. The literature of the subject at the time saw many interesting works. Those published at the turn 
of the millennium are another sign of the 1990s “renaissance” in Polish psychology of religion, since many of them were then being prepared for publication. Among those is a collection of works on the spiritual development, under Socha’s (2000) edition, Zdzisław Kroplewski’s (2002) mono-graph Rationality of Religious Reasoning.

Introduction
Already in the early 1980s, scholars started noticing that a growing number 
of women and couples were choosing to have no offspring (Bloom & Pebley, 1982; Veevers, 1980; Veevers & Houseknecht, 1981). Across modern societ-ies, voluntary childlessness
1 is believed to significantly contribute to overall 
trends of childlessness (Berrington, 2017; Kreyenfeld & Konietzka, 2017; Rowland, 2007; Tanturri & Mencarini, 2008). Because a lack of offspring has important consequences for individual well-being (Angeles, 2010; Hansen, Slagsvold, & Moum, 2009), old-age security (Wenger, 2009), and welfare state entitlements (Dykstra, 2009), it is important to understand reasons why people choose to forego childbearing. Nonetheless, the motivational process that leads to this choice is still not sufficiently understood (Avison & Furnham, 2015; Frejka, 2017; Langdridge, Sheeran, & Connolly, 2005; Park, 2005). The choice to remain childless seems particularly puzzling in countries like 
Poland, where attachment to religion and family values is strong (Burkimsher, 2014; Fokkema & Esveldt, 2008; Giza-Poleszczuk & Poleszczuk, 2004), childlessness is stigmatized (Mynarska, 2010), and children are the main pro-viders of practical and emotional support to elderly parents (Bojanowska, 2009). Until recently, few Polish women remained childless. Among women born in 1960, slightly under 7% never became mothers and this share was among the lowest in Europe (Sobotka, 2017)."

of our sample was compared with a subsample of childless men and women 
aged 25 to 44 years derived from a nationally representative (weighted) data set of the Polish Generations and Gender Survey. As for a place of residence and education, the structure of our sample resembled the overall population of childless Poles in the given age range relatively well, although individuals living in villages and low educated were underrepresented, especially among men. Moreover, individuals in unions were overrepresented. Such a composi-tion is favorable for studying people’s choices to remain childless, as our sample was not dominated by individuals who were prevented from having children by the lack of a partner or by their difficult economic situation. Nonetheless, this limitation needs to be considered when an attempt to gen-eralize our findings is made."
10-1177_0192513x19868257.pdf,Union,"The scores of the subscales reflect how rel-evant any given (positive or negative) motive was for each respondent. For instance, a high score on a PCM subscale “joy of pregnancy, birth, and infancy” meant that the respondent perceived these potential benefits (values) of childbearing as highly desirable. Similarly, a high score on a NCM subscale “fears and worries of parenthood” indicated that the respondent perceived Mynarska and Rytel 11
these potentially negative consequences of parenthood as highly undesirable. The internal consistency of the subscales varied from 0.683 to 0.916. Only the subscale related to the discomforts of pregnancy and delivery, which consisted of just two items, had an internal consistency of below 0.7. Additionally, we included the respondents’ basic demographic variables 
as controls: age (based on the year of birth), education (three levels: basic vocational or lower, secondary or postsecondary, and at least a bachelor’s degree), union status (married or cohabiting vs. single or in a living-apart-together relationship), and place of residence (four levels: city of at least 500,000 citizens, city of 100,000-499,000 citizens, city under 100,000 citi-zens, village). Finally, we controlled for the mode of data collection, as the data were collected both face-to-face and online. Analytic Approach
We addressed our research question by applying a multiple regression analy-sis that predicted the desire to have a child (dependent variable) using a set of childbearing motives (explanatory variables). We decided to apply a linear regression approach because our dependent and key explanatory variables were continuous and all of the assumptions for regression were met. Age was also treated as a continuous variable, while the remaining control variables were entered as dummy variables. Analyses were run separately for men and women using SPSS 25.0 software."

Table 4 shows the correlations between our dependent variable of child-
bearing desire and childbearing motives. As posited in the Traits-Desires-
Intentions-Behavior model, childbearing desires were found to correlate positively with PCM and negatively with NCM. All correlations were statisti-cally significant, except for the correlation between childbearing desires and “discomforts of pregnancy and delivery” in the male sample. Multiple Regression Analysis
In the next step, all childbearing motives were entered into the regression equation as predictors of childbearing desire. Respondents’ age, education, union status, and place of residence, as well as the mode of data collection, were introduced as control variables. For both men and women, the regres-sion models were significant and the variables explained more than half of the total variance in childbearing desires. As the results presented in Table 5 indicate, not all of the motives were statistically significant. We also found clear differences between men and women. Among women, two positive motives, “feeling needed and connected” 
and “joys of pregnancy, birth, and infancy” were identified as being predic-tive of stronger childbearing desire. Among men, the significant predictors of stronger childbearing desire were “satisfaction of child rearing” and “tradi-tional parenthood.”
Looking at NCM, we found that “negatives of child care” were associated 
with significantly reduced childbearing desire among both men and women."

Participants
A total of N  = 350 families of ex-athletes with partners and children (152 
of whom were girls) participated in the study. In each family, both parents 
have completed questionnaires for only one child. Individuals who fulfilled the following criteria were included in the ex-athletes’ group: having played sports competitively for at least 5 years and having been a member of a sports club (M  = 8.80, SD =  5.10). The participants in this group formerly 
practice martial arts (n  = 55 male, n  = 45 female), team sports (n  = 90 
male, n = 73 female), and individual sports (n  = 53 male, n  = 34 female). The average age of the female ex-athletes was M  = 34.20 (SD =  5.29) and 
of the male ex-athletes was M  = 36.73 (SD = 5.63). The control group 
consisted of an equivalent number of families (N  = 336) in which neither 
of the parents had done sports in the past, according to these criteria. In the non-ex-athlete group, the average ages were M  = 34.47 (SD = 5.05) for 
females and M  = 36.88 (SD = 5.69) for males. The age of the children was 
purposely uniform (M

10-1177_0886260517696868.pdf,Union,"We further found that problem-solving coping can buffer the negative impact that poly-victimization has on life satisfaction and positive affect. With regard to prevalence, 84% reported experiencing at least one type of 
victimization over the previous year and 35% had experienced a high level of different victimizations, and were classed as poly-victims. Although com-parisons between victimization rates in this study and those from different countries are limited by methodological differences (e.g., types of victimiza-tions measured, threshold of poly-victimization, sample age range), the fre-quency of victimizations is consistent with past studies which have found rates ranging from 62% (Romano et al., 2011) to 88% (Soler, Paretilla, Kirchner, & Forns, 2012). The proportion of poly-victimized adolescents in our sample, however, 
appears to be higher than reported in prior research from the United States and Western Europe, where past-year poly-victimization has ranged from 9% (Cyr et al., 2013) to 22% (Finkelhor et al., 2007a). However, a study investi-gating poly-victimization in an Eastern European culture also found elevated rates of poly-victimization (Bogolyubova et al., 2015). Some possible rea-sons for the higher frequency of poly-victimization found in Eastern Europe could be connected to the period of economic and political instability which followed the collapse of the Soviet Union. During this period, many social problems went unrecognized or underestimated (Sajkowska, 2010), and as such, Eastern European countries may have less national programs in place to address childhood victimizations (Craig et al., 2009), resulting in a higher 
prevalence. In addition, compared to other Eastern European countries, Polish adults were more likely to endorse the use of capital punishment 16 Journal of Interpersonal Violence 
(Sajkowska, 2010) and Polish children had a higher level of aggression 
acceptance, compared to U.S. and Finnish samples (Österman et al., 1994). These past findings suggest that it may be more acceptable to use violence and aggression in the Polish culture. At the individual level, being rated by teachers as disruptive or withdrawn 
was predictive of poly-victimization. These findings are consistent with prior poly-victimization research showing that emotional problems are a pathway to poly-victimization (Finkelhor et al., 2009), and with the peer victimization literature, which has found that victims typically fall into one of two catego-ries: passive or aggressive (Olweus, 1978; Schwartz, Dodge, & Coie, 1993)."

A Study of Polish Football Fandom

The main aim of this article is to show some characteristics of the identity of Polish 
football supporters. The results of a study conducted among 309 fans actively engaged in formal (supporters’ associations) and informal groups (e.g., hooligans or 
ultras), as well as data from qualitative research, reveal their strong identification 
with Poland as a country, with their family, club, and group of supporters. at the 
same time, Polish fans do not identify with “europe” as a category. The fandom culture in Poland is characterized by such attitudes as honour, steadfastness, the 
“might is right” principle, and moral and economic conservatism. Supporters tend to 
sympathize with political parties embracing right-wing values. The article points out important elements of Polish history that could have affected the ideological con-struction of the supporters’ vision. In the absence of historical civic and left-wing tradition, Polish supporters emerged during the period of the country’s struggle for 
freedom as a community structured by militant, conservative, punitive, and mascu-
line frames of reference."

social movements, and social engagement.6 an important field of research addition-
ally is the social identity of fans7 as well as their political engagement.8 Fans from 
great Britain,9 germany,10 Spain,11 Italy,12 and the Balkans13 have been analysed in 
a number of comprehensive studies published in english. The primary objective of this article therefore is to present some socio-cultural 
dimensions of football fandom in Poland, including identity and political attitudes. More specifically, our goal was to explore the prevailing political attitudes of people engaged in football fandom, both by assessing their subjective self-identification with the economic and social “right” versus “left,” and by asking them about their voting behaviour. Moreover, we wanted to examine whether the state of fusion (the state when the personal and social identities of fused persons combine synergisti-cally) with football fandom will predict willingness to fight and die for one’s own group. Finally, we hypothesized that the social identities of the fans would be more locally driven. To test this, we examine if fans indeed identify more strongly with club and country, as compared to a more abstract category (“europe”). apart from 
identifying the characteristics of Polish supporters, the article is an attempt to answer the question concerning the importance of social (cultural) context in the shaping of such characteristics. In spite of the hermetic nature of the fan world, fans—at least to a certain extent—are representatives of society and are thus exposed to the influ-ences and transformations that society undergoes. We believe, therefore, that analys-ing the history of a particular country is necessary to fully understand the phenomenon of fandom. 14
In our case, the national frame—Polish history, including the cultural and social 
transformation of the country—appears to be a crucial background for the analysis. We assume that political attitudes of Polish fans, their attitudes to moral values, etc., are strongly connected to the national background."

Polish fans conservative in terms of cultural-moral, social, and economic values? Is 
willingness to fight for one’s own group related to the level of identity fusion with fans? Which group (hooligans, ultras, supporters’ association, patriotic groups, etc.) has the strongest willingness to defend themselves and which express the most con-servative views? Do demographic variables (e.g., gender, age, and education) affect pro-group behaviour in the conditions of identity fusion? What is the importance of the following for the surveyed fans: family, friends, the club, supporters of the club, Poland, and europe? at the same time, it was interesting to learn not only which group (hooligans, 
ultras, etc.) is characterized by a particular attitude but also how Polish fans describe their own identity and their group in narrative. Therefore, quantitative data (scales of measurement) are complemented by qualitative data from in-depth interviews, con-tent analysis, and participant observation. Such a procedure is not considered in terms of “increasing” objectivity but rather as deepening knowledge and understand-ing of the phenomenon. We follow the triangulation approach developed by Uwe Flick, who states that “if the issue in question requires more than one approach, it may be necessary to include more than one researcher ."
10-1177_0888325418756991.pdf,Club,"We both think that in the case of such a topic as “identity” (which is not universally fixed but dynamically constructed),
20 it is worth following different, even seemingly incon-
gruent, methodological paths. For example, the pictorial measure of identity fusion is a valuable tool for the study of this phenomenon, as it shows which group iden-tity overlaps personal identity more strongly. However, it does not answer the question why this is so and what it really means. It is therefore important to con-sider the context in which the group functions, as well as to concentrate on the narratives of its members (i.e., the interviews). Therefore, each of the research questions can be considered at many levels: frequencies and correlations but also meanings, attitudes, and reflexivity. The study was conducted among football supporters who declared their active 
engagement in formal (supporters’ association) or informal social groups (e.g., ultras or hooligan groups) related to the club and football.4 east european Politics and Societies and Cultures

mation on the measure). The next scale concerned “Identity fusion with various social groups.” The picto-
rial measure of identity fusion with social groups was based on a simple wordless scale on which the participants were to mark their relationships with the groups (e.g., Kossakowski and Besta / Polish Football Fandom 5
with Poland).23 Option a designated total independence of the self from the group, 
while option e signified a complete overlap of the self-concept and the group (see 
Figure 1). This measure is a modified version of inclusion of other in the self-scale24 
and was previously used several times to assess the strength of relationships and identity fusion with a group. 25
In the “Right-wing economic and cultural beliefs scale,” we included measures 
of cultural and economic conservatism, considering that a distinction between these two dimensions of political belief has often been made in previous research."
10-1177_0888325418756991.pdf,Club,"In the cultural/values domain, right-wing ideology favours tradition and well-established social roles in the context of marriage, gen-der roles, child rearing, or same-sex relationships. We used one item for economic right-wing beliefs, with a scale anchored at 1 (I support . . . progressive taxation, welfare-state, the state has a role in economy) and 10 (I support . . . totally free market economy, the state has no role in regulating markets); and one item for the cultural dimension of right-wing beliefs, on a scale from 1 to 10 (“When it comes to cultural issues, my opinions on religion, gender roles, same-sex marriages or abortion, are”: 1 = left-wing/liberal/progressive to 10 = right-wing/conservative/traditional). Finally, we used a scale of “Willingness to fight and die for one’s own social 
group.” as a measure of the tendency to engage in defence of the group and fight for 
other in-group members, we applied a five-item scale previously used by gómez  
et al. 27 with such items as “I would fight someone physically threatening another 
supporter of my club” (α = .92). Before presenting the results of this research, we discuss the relationships among

Political engagement is an extremely important dimension of fan identity. The 
“politicization” of fandom is connected with a particular local context. In Italy, ultra groups absorbed a local political identity in the process, referred to as “neo-local-ism,”
33 resulting in the spread of fascist or extreme-left ideology.34 Certain fans from 
the Balkans were engaged in the Yugoslav War in the 1990s and today they refer to nationalist symbols. 35 Football has a great significance for “Scottishness,”36 with its 
basic principle of setting it apart from english identity. On the other hand, supporters of german FC St. Pauli promote an inclusive, anti-discriminatory identity referring 
to universal values beyond the local and national context."
10-1177_0888325418756991.pdf,Club,"as a consequence, the Polish 
left had to reconstruct itself from scratch, both politically and culturally, after system transformation. In a historical perspective, the years of struggle for a national identity, the destruc-
tion of intellectual elites, the cultural and civilizational backwardness of the com-munist era, the very modest civic attitudes accepting otherness, and the lack of a left-wing tradition are the factors that have had an impact on the peculiarly conserva-tive nature of Polish society. Today, it is coupled with the uncertainty of a market economy, the crisis of liberal democracy in europe,
61 and the fear of refugees (public 
opinion polls reveal that 53 percent of respondents do not want to accept refugees from the Middle east). 62 In a sense, therefore, the growth of identity-based, axiologi-
cal, and symbolic dimensions of the Polish fan movement stems from historical developments.12 east european Politics and Societies and Cultures
Research Findings
Preliminary analyses show that the measures we used in our study were reliable 
(see Table 1). Correlation analyses between variables measured with verbal scales 
showed that all identity fusion is strongly related to a willingness to fight for one’s own group and to the right-wing cultural dimension (but not to the economic one) (see Table 2). Identity Fusion with Various Social Groups
In order to examine how our participants perceived their relation with their 
families, friends, the club, other football supporters, the country, and europe, we analysed the results on pictorial scales. Figures 1 to 6 show detailed answers indicat-ing that the majority of football supporters chose the overlap between the self and the family and between the self and the country. We assume that this is a sign of commitment to conservative ideas. In the case of the family, Polish fans firmly dem-onstrate what kind of relationships they accept. Wisła Cracow ultras presented a choreography with a crossed-out picture of a same-sex male couple (“no gays”). a 
similar performance was displayed by Obra Kościan fans who connected two slo-gans: “Homosexuality forbidden” and “a  boy and a girl = a normal family.” In 
Poland, there are no official groups of gay fans."

It seems to me that it’s like in a family. There are people you are a bit closer with; there 
are people you would die for; there are people you are more distant from, but you still feel that it’s your group, they are your people. and if I see that one of them is going to 
get hurt, I help them in some way. Still, I think that there are some groups of fans—like ultra groups or some sorts of hooligan groups—which are the best example of such small families. [ŁKS Łódź_supporter]
The importance of the family is also highlighted by the fact that family members, 
most often the father, play the most important role in socialization into the role of supporter. There are numerous statements similar to the following one:
In my case, it all began in the family: my dad always went to the games and at some 
point he took me along."

The overlap of the club and fan identity is manifested by such symbolic slogans as 
“Lechia Is Us,” “Cracovia Is Us,” displayed on flags and banners. The clubs provide their fans with a sense of the longue durée and function as a source of “mnemic energy,”
63 which is very important for their identity. This sense of unity is the case 
despite the fact that in structural and formal terms, clubs belong to completely differ -
ent people and the fans have practically no impact on their management. The lowest level of fusion was observed in the context of relation to europe, with 
the majority of fans indicating no relation at all (see Figures 1 to 6 for details). The lack of identification with europe appears to be interesting in the context of the data revealing that 72 percent of Poles are classified as adherents of the european Union. 64 
It is crucial to note, however, that most of the surveyed fans selected right-wing par -
ties as their political preference (with the nationalist National Movement, RN, at the Kossakowski and Besta / Polish Football Fandom 17
top of the list)."
10-1177_0888325418756991.pdf,Club,"Regarding persons belonging to formal associations and not affiliated with any informal groups, their political preferences were also mostly in favour of the National Movement (31.8 percent). On the other hand, centre-liberal parties gained stronger support: PO (13.6 percent), Nowoczesna (“Modern,” a new party lead by the economic liberal Ryszard Petru, 4.5 percent; in the whole group, Nowoczesna gained only 1.9 percent). Support for other right-wing parties was as follows: Kukiz’15, 18.2 percent; KORWiN, 9.1 percent. Interestingly, in the case of hooligans, the winner in political preferences was KORWiN (29.4 percent), followed by the National Movement (20.6 percent), Kukiz’15 (14.7 percent), and the Civic Platform (5.9 percent).

of identity fusion with various social groups. In the second regression analysis, we included the first and second steps as above, but this time in the third step we added Table 3

ball supporters, Poland, and europe (see Table 4). Here, identity fusion with other supporters was also the strongest predictor of willingness to fight in defence of other in-group members, and the standardized beta coefficient for identity fusion was two times stronger than for the next significant variable, that is, membership in a hooli-gan or patriotic activity sub-groups. Interestingly, when controlling for relation with other groups, identity fusion with europe and with the family were negatively related 
to the willingness to fight for the group. The following comment from one of the supporters is quite characteristic:
For me, when I think of Lechia, I think of the guys I used to travel with to see away 
games; it’s about community, about standing by one another. I’ve never been betrayed by any of the guys in any way; you could always count on them. Today, they are god-
fathers to their fellow fans’ children, best men at their weddings, so it’s more than just 
going out for a beer together before the match and screaming your head off at the game."

left in Poland is still considerable, and political parties referring to the values of the modern left (high taxation, gay rights, the right to abortion, etc.) receive only small support (left-wing parties failed to win a single seat in the last parliamentary elec-tions in 2015). andrzej Leder
60 argues that the left in Poland “vanished” in the course 
of dialogue between the communist authorities and the Solidarity movement (the first independent trade union not controlled by the communist state, founded in 1980 under the leadership of Lech Wałęsa; the movement initiated the changes leading to the transformation of the system in 1989). It was a kind of evasive tactic necessary during the fight against an authoritarian system based on left-wing ideology. In addi-tion, the Roman Catholic Church played an important role in the struggle against communism, becoming one of the crucial actors in the social context (and one that has an influence on public debate to this day), hence it was difficult at the time to promote leftist ideas (e.g., a religiously neutral state). as a consequence, the Polish 
left had to reconstruct itself from scratch, both politically and culturally, after system transformation. In a historical perspective, the years of struggle for a national identity, the destruc-
tion of intellectual elites, the cultural and civilizational backwardness of the com-munist era, the very modest civic attitudes accepting otherness, and the lack of a left-wing tradition are the factors that have had an impact on the peculiarly conserva-tive nature of Polish society. Today, it is coupled with the uncertainty of a market economy, the crisis of liberal democracy in europe,
61 and the fear of refugees (public 
opinion polls reveal that 53 percent of respondents do not want to accept refugees from the Middle east)."

The overlap of the club and fan identity is manifested by such symbolic slogans as 
“Lechia Is Us,” “Cracovia Is Us,” displayed on flags and banners. The clubs provide their fans with a sense of the longue durée and function as a source of “mnemic energy,”
63 which is very important for their identity. This sense of unity is the case 
despite the fact that in structural and formal terms, clubs belong to completely differ -
ent people and the fans have practically no impact on their management. The lowest level of fusion was observed in the context of relation to europe, with 
the majority of fans indicating no relation at all (see Figures 1 to 6 for details). The lack of identification with europe appears to be interesting in the context of the data revealing that 72 percent of Poles are classified as adherents of the european Union. 64 
It is crucial to note, however, that most of the surveyed fans selected right-wing par -
ties as their political preference (with the nationalist National Movement, RN, at the Kossakowski and Besta / Polish Football Fandom 17
top of the list). These parties are sceptical about european integration, and during the 
refugee crisis, their voice was even more radical. One of the supporters explains why “europe” is not a point of reference for the fans:
The West in general has a huge problem; they have given up their identity. . . . It’s 
because of all those long years of political correctness, all those revolutions and a wrong approach to democracy. . . . It’s their fault that today it’s generally difficult to 
talk about europeanness in europe. What is it supposed to be like? Wearing turbans or 
what?"

This situation demonstrates the rules of “honour” and “respect” among hooligans: 
during a national holiday, animosities are suspended because all participants cele-brate a day that is important for Poland as such. at the same time, while hooligans are characterized by a low level of economic 
conservatism, the corresponding figures for members of supporters’ associations are the highest. Perhaps the latter group needs to be more aware of economic factors, as they are the ones who are responsible for collecting funds for supporters’ actions or commercial activity (e.g., the sales of fan paraphernalia). On the other hand, the main field of hooligan activity is not associated with this sphere. When it comes to political preferences, participants generally favoured the right-
wing and national parties. The National Movement commanded the strongest sup-port (27 percent) and was followed by the Kukiz’15 Movement (19.7 percent), “KORWiN” (the political movement led by Janusz Korwin-Mikke, a vehement opponent of the european Union, 18.1 percent; National Movement, Kukiz’15, and KORWiN are radical, antisystem movements with a very critical attitude to european Union. They are characterized by strong right-wing attitudes in terms of economy and—in most cases—moral values, for example, the Law and Justice (Prawo i Sprawidliwość [PiS]), winner of the last parliamentary elections in 2015 (4.5 per -
cent), and the Civic Platform (Platforma Obywatelska [PO]), a centre-liberal party forming the coalition government in 2007–2015 (4.2 percent). Other political parties (including the left-wing ones) gained below 2 percent (19.7 percent respondents did not identify with any party). Regarding persons belonging to formal associations and not affiliated with any informal groups, their political preferences were also mostly in favour of the National Movement (31.8 percent). On the other hand, centre-liberal parties gained stronger support: PO (13.6 percent), Nowoczesna (“Modern,” a new party lead by the economic liberal Ryszard Petru, 4.5 percent; in the whole group, Nowoczesna gained only 1.9 percent). Support for other right-wing parties was as follows: Kukiz’15, 18.2 percent; KORWiN, 9.1 percent."

of these borders may be a significant point of departure for a new understanding of
the concept of emancipation. The overarching aim of this book is to “examine subjectivity in a highly medi-
ated cultural context” (Riley et al., 2018, p. 1) and to avoid over-simplified under-
standings of media “influence”. Such an approach also avoids the colonisation ofknowledge by generalising decontextualised claims, especially when formulated in
privileged contexts. As such, I understand the choice to address only “the
Anglophone world”. However, the authors’ claim that a postfeminist sensibilityin health is embedded across the West and perhaps is developing in some other
countries is not only inaccurate but left me, as a Central European woman, with a
feeling of exclusion that I decided to treat as informative. Even if this feeling isabout being excluded from the ailments of the “rich club”, there remains a ques-
tion, most certainly important for the authors: Does this exclusion lead us in the
direction of social justice? While it is good practice to explicitly situate qualitativesocial research within its cultural origin, showing the necessary awareness of
research limitation, at the same time, depending from where in the world the
authors speak, there is also a chance that this practice will establish an unspokennorm or a culturally specific niche. The exclusion of cultural contexts outside the
Anglophone world, albeit done in the interests of accuracy, is not only inaccurate
but unjust in that it inadvertently reiterates the divide between parts of the worldthat used to be addressed as “developed” and “developing”. (The term
“developing” is even used, like a Freudian slip of the tongue.) This is ironic in a
text that explicitly aims to avoid neo-colonialist practices. For me, this is an addi-tional evidence of the insidious nature of the very discourses the authors highlight
in their work."

career, and achieve professional success (Kosakowska, 2008; Moss-Racusin, Phelan, Rudman, 2010) while restraining from feminine roles, which entail domestic work and parenting (Poortman & Van der Lippe, 2009; Prentice & Carranza, 2002; Safdar & Kosakowska-Berezecka, 2015; Vandello & Bosson, 2013; Williams & Best, 1990). According to biosocial construction theory (Wood & Eagly, 2010, 2012), across societ-ies, the division of labor between women and men reflects (a) societal norms concern-ing gender roles one internalizes during childhood and (b) biological characteristics of both genders (i.e., women giving birth and men having physical strength). If both gen-ders undertake activities that are similarly valued in the society, one would expect to observe less pronounced division of labor along the lines of gender stereotypes and sex traits would also be considered more similar. Research shows that stereotypes of women as communal and men as agentic are weaker in societies with more gender equality, where women and men are more allowed to perform similar roles in society (Glick & Fiske, 2001; Wood & Eagly, 2012). As a consequence, seeing a men focused solely on household duties and parenting (instead of being focused on his professional career) might be less judged through the lens of gender stereotypes (implying that household duties and parenting are women’s job; cf. Kosakowska-Berezecka, Żadkowska, et al., 2016). In an experimental study, researchers (Kosakowska-Berezecka, Jurek, Besta, Korzeniewska, & Seibt, 2016) asked Norwegian and Polish students to judge how typi-cal several domestic duties (e.g., vacuuming, preparing meals for the family, washing the car, and small household repairs) were for women and men."

Common Traits
A few participants described common traits as characteristic of EG, including U.S. students (see Note 21), Mexicans (e.g., “Ethnic group is a group of peo-ple who share traits and behaviors, which are generally attributed to the fact of belonging to or being born in a particular place
45” [20M], or another 
20-year-old male who mentioned, “liking cheerful music” as a trait of Latin Americans), Britons (“the sense of humor associated with England” [19F]), and Poles (e.g., “Group, which has its own separate core, distinguishing itself by some traits or connected with each other because of the location”
46 [22F])."
10-1177_1069397118816939.pdf,Club,"Of course, it is impossible to say if this result is not just a reflection of views among Polish scholars (see, for example, Rykala, 2014) and national censuses, as radiated through various media. Still, the most common associa-tion in this category was skin color, probably because this is the most popular understanding of the term “race” in Poland. Interestingly, some respondents seemed to identify “race” with being Slavic. Again, Poles used their own group as point of reference. “Shared beliefs/values/morals” was considered an aspect of the definition 
of “ethnic group” by just 9% of Polish students, with almost 10 other charac-teristics of EG mentioned more often. Interestingly, a few Poles referred to similar activities and interests as definitions of “ethnic group” (members of a club, runners, people who love travels, or another shared hobby). Some oth-ers referred to inhabitants of favorite cities as examples of EG, perhaps show-ing their attachment to local communities, confusion about what EG means, or perhaps attempting to override the historical “ethno-nation” discourse with a more modern perspective.60 Cross-Cultural Research 54(1)
Patterns of the definitions
These differences in the patterns of defining the “ethnic group” concept in 
four different countries appear to confirm Weber’s notion that there are no universal traits characterizing EGs. In addition, our results showed that the idea according to which the constructs of “racial” and ethnic identities are largely overlapping (Phinney & Ong, 2007) or that “race” and ethnicity should be merged into a “race-ethnicity” construct (e.g., Fouad & Byars-Winston, 2005) would be incorrect for many cultures and nations other than the United States and the United Kingdom (see also, for example, Helms & Talleyrand, 1997). We believe that such an approach would dis-tort the picture of the “ethnic group” construct and explain less, not more. The results of our studies conducted in cross-cultural context support this conclusion. However, even for the United States, with increasing numbers of 
mixed ethnicities, such a “race-ethnicity” approach may be misleading (Benet-Martínez, 2008)."
10-1177_1069397118816939.pdf,Union,"Poland is also more on the “survival” side 
of the “survival” versus “self-expression” dimension than the remaining three countries, which means more emphasis on economic and physical secu-rity and a relatively ethnocentric outlook (World Values Survey, 2015). The Inglehart–Welzel approach was expanded by Haller (2002), introduc-
ing the “deeper level-analysis” for both dimensions, which also differentiates the four countries analyzed in this article. His analysis of the “survival” ver -
sus “self-expression” dimension resulted in the concept of “nationhood”—the process of nation building and the security and pride of national identity. Moreover, following the “traditional” versus “secular-rational” values dimen-sion, Haller (2002) differentiated general types of relations between reli-gions/churches and states. The characteristics of the four countries tested, which may be necessary 
for understanding the potential differences in “ethnic group” definitions are summarized below. ••The United Kingdom, a sovereign state in Western Europe, consisting of four countries: England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland; a part of the European Union (the present research was conducted half a year before the Brexit vote):
In Haller’s analysis, the United Kingdom is described as a typical example 
of a “state nation” in which the state created the nation by introducing compre-hensive education and language, national symbols, and so forth, as a deliber -
ate political strategy. Anyone may become a member of such a “state nation” if they are willing to learn its language and respect its laws and institutions (Haller, 2002). The United Kingdom is also an example of a country where the comprehensive state renders superfluous or replaces religious communities with a historical “state religion”; today, it is a quite well-developed welfare state, reporting a decline in religiosity. According to the 2011 census (Office for National Statistics [ONS], 2013), in England and Wales, 25% reported not being religious, 59% were Christians, and 5% Muslims. In Scotland’s Census (2011b), 32% declared membership in the Church of Scotland, 16% were Roman Catholics, other Catholics were 6%, Muslims were 1%, other religions were 1%, not stated were 7%, and not religious were 37%. As for ethnic/“racial” groups officially recognized in the United Kingdom, 
the ONS (2011) combines “race” and nationality as an EG classification scheme."
10-1177_1069397118816939.pdf,Union,"citizens in 2016 (ONS, 2017). These data allow us to suspect that, with high immigration rates, cultural fac-tors, including religion and language, often different from traditional ones in the country, may be categories of rising importance in the social perception of the meaning of “ethnic group” in the United Kingdom. In addition, the fact that four countries in the United Kingdom occupy different territories and have separate censuses (as well as separate national assemblies, sports teams, etc.) suggests that British nationals may have a fine-grained identity. Thus, geographical and national references may be another important category among EG definitions in the United Kingdom. ••Poland, a country in Central/Eastern Europe, part of the European Union:
Poland is considered a nationally and religiously homogeneous state, as 
the index of ethnic cohesion (more than 97%) sets it on one of the first places in Europe, and even in the world at large (Rykala, 2014). As a “monoracial” country (almost only “White,” as “race” is often understood in Poland as a skin color), Poland does not have official data on “racial” groupings—in the Statistical Yearbook of the Republic of Poland, the word “race” is never used (Central Statistical Office, 2015). The Polish Ministry of Internal Affairs dis-tinguishes nine national minorities (Belarusians, Czechs, Lithuanians, Germans, Ormians, Russians, Slovaks, Ukrainians, Jews), four ethnic minor -
ities (Karaim, Lemko, Romani, Tatar), and one language minority (Kashubian; Ministerstwo Spraw Wewnętrznych i Administracji, 2017). However, accord-ing to the National Census from 2011, none of these exceeded 0.5% of the Polish population.38 Cross-Cultural Research 54(1)
Polish is the official language in Poland, although in some communities, 
auxiliary official languages are allowed (German, Belarusian, Lithuanian, 
and Kashubian). As the National Census from 2002 showed, the Polish lan-guage was used at home by a group of people larger (97.8% of the overall population) than the group declaring Polish nationality (96.7%; Rykala, 2014). This was the first census after WWII to provide statistical data on the national identification of Poles."
10-1177_1069397118816939.pdf,Union,"Previous analyses showed the importance of a temporal approach to “ethnic group” definitions. The case of the evolving attitudes toward Irish immigrants since they mass immigrated to the United Kingdom shows that, at the beginning, they were portrayed as “Black” and treated as inferior despite their white skin tone (Judd, 1996; Lebow, 1976). Today the word “British” refers collectively to all people of Great Britain, whereas in the 17th century, it meant only English people, as Irish and Scots were perceived as too different (Schaefer, 2008). Another example may be the changing per -
spective on ethnicity in the United States, where “at one point, diversity . . . was cast in biracial, almost caste-like terms as a Black-White issue with American Indians and Asian immigrants virtually ignored” (Schaefer, 2008, p. xlvii), but by the end of the 20th century, the discourse changed into talks 62 Cross-Cultural Research 54(1)
about the triracial nature of the United States or the Latinization of America, 
while ignoring many other socially defined groups (e.g., Pacific Islanders or tribal groups). Such longitudinal studies could shed more light on how changes in soci-
etal and political context relate to changes in individuals’ understanding of the term “ethnic group.” For example, it would be important to see how peo-ple change their understanding of the concept of EG with increasing numbers of ethnic intermarriages, creating more mixed populations (Schaefer, 2008), how Poles change their definitions of EG as the society becomes more mul-ticultural due to immigration, or how the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union is related to changes in individuals’ descriptions of “ethnic group.” Moreover, given past patterns and current trends, we cannot be cer -
tain that today’s group categories will still be valid in the future (Burton et al., 2005; Schaefer, 2008; Zelinsky, 2001), so we believe that studies such as presented in this article will remain useful and should be continued. Conclusions
In this cross-sectional and cross-cultural study, we investigated how respon-dents from four countries (the United States, the United Kingdom, Poland, and Mexico) understand and describe the term “ethnic group.” This study provides empirical evidence that individuals from different countries perceive and describe the term in different ways. The summary of national patterns of results seems to make it clear that, in the minds of ordinary people, definitions of the term “ethnic group” are highly culture dependent, and that most partici-pants use their own country’s ethnocultural and historical context together with official grouping used by national censuses as their basic points of refer -
ence. Respondents from the United States predominantly connected EG to “race”; British participants perceived EG as also related to “race,” but even more to “common culture” and “customs/traditions.” Mexican and Polish respondents also predominantly described EG as related to and expressed in “common culture” and “customs/traditions.” However, “nation,” “shared his-tory,” “religion,” “language,” and “territory” were also very popular as EG understandings in Poland. Unexpected definitions of EG also appeared, for example, people having similar hobbies, work goals, or living in the same city. In addition, our study showed that most participants used the newer defini-
tion of EG (referring to all groups in a society, including minority and major -
ity groups)."

Prevalence of Violence Against Women
Violence against women has been described as one of the most pervasive human right violations of modern times (World Health Organization [WHO], 2013). Broadly defined as, “any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or mental harm or suffering to women” (United Nations, 1995, p. 76), recent figures suggest one in three women will be victimized in their lifetime (WHO, 2013). Importantly, the majority of physical and sexual violence is shown to be com-mitted by an intimate partner. Despite variations between countries, large-scale popu-lation-based surveys display many regions where in excess of 60% of women experience some form of intimate partner violence (IPV; Garcia-Moreno, Jansen, Ellsberg, Heise, & Watts, 2006; United Nations Children’s Fund, 2015; WHO, 2013). Although the number of convictions for IPV are reportedly increasing throughout Europe as a whole, repeat victimization remains high (Crown Prosecution Service, 2015) and as many as 66% of IPV offenders have been reported to recidivate within the first year after prison release (Loinaz, 2014). In considering the prevalence, seri-ousness, and significant monetary costs (see DeLisi et al., 2010; Wickramasekera, Wright, Elsey, Murray, & Tubeuf, 2015) of such offenses, a greater understanding of the factors that precipitate perpetration is required to effectively tackle the problem. Attitudes Toward Sexual Violence
One explanation attempting to account for high prevalence rates of IPV are the com-monly held attitudes supportive of violence within relationships, and in particular sexual violence (WHO, 2016). Numerous studies have demonstrated evidence of a relationship between negative attitudes toward women and a proclivity for sexual vio-lence (Alleyne, Gannon, Ciardha, & Wood, 2014; Blake & Gannon, 2010; Bohner, Pina, Viki, & Siebler, 2010; Bohner, Siebler, & Schmelcher, 2006; Lonsway & Fitzgerald, 1994). Rape myths are an example of such attitudes, equating to “beliefs that are generally false, but are widely and persistently held and that serve to deny and justify male sexual aggression” (Lonsway & Fitzgerald, 1994, p. 134)."

Introduction
According to the United Nations, the number of inter-
national migrants worldwide exceeded 244 million andis likely to rise in the future (UN DESA, 2015). Polandis no exception to this trend. Despite the radical anti-
immigration rhetoric largely present in the Polish polit-
ical discourse (Krzy _zanowski, 2017), in recent years,
the country has become home to thousands of foreign-ers. The exact numbers are difﬁcult to estimate, due tocircular and mobile nature of these migrations, as well
as potentially large number of undocumented migra-
tions (Pe Rdziwiatr, 2014). The largest number of immi-
grants in Poland hail from the former Soviet Union,especially from Ukraine, where the recent Russianannexation of Crimea and the subsequent outbreak
of armed conﬂict in the Donbass area led to a severe
breakdown of the Ukrainian economy (Polish Ofﬁcefor Foreigners, 2017). In 2016, Polish authoritiesissued 1.26 million temporary work permits to
Ukrainians, whereas in the ﬁrst ﬁve months of 2017,their number increased by 50% and is expected to surge
even more in coming years (Polish Ofﬁce for
Foreigners, 2017). Whereas immigration to Polandand integration policies regarding it are in the early
stages of development (Polish Ministry of Internal
Affairs, 2012), the experience of other

immigrant-receiving countries shows that disregarding
integration problems may result in much more seriousproblems in the future (e.g., Koopmans, 2010). Immigrant adaptation
Central to the concept of migrant integration is thenotion of adaptation to living in the receiving country.Although the majority of immigrants learn culturallyappropriate skills that are needed to operate effectively
in the receiving country, many struggle with stress and
coping, sometimes to the extent that it affects theirmental health (Bhugra, 2004; Lindert, vonEhrenstein, Priebe, Mielck, & Br €ahler, 2009; Sam,
Vedder, Liebkind, Neto, & Virta, 2008). This is whyimmigrant adaptation has been divided into two cate-gories: socio-cultural and psychological adaptation.Socio-cultural adaptation refers to behavioural aspects

different accounts for this incongruity are discussed. Firstly, parents in the UK may set higher benchmarks for their children’s minority language skills than the parents in Norway. Alternative accounts of this interpretation related to differences in the parents’ socio-economic background, minority language proficiency or language attitudes are discussed. Secondly, parental report may indicate early stages of attrition of the minority language among the children in the UK that the direct lexical assessment tool may not be sensitive enough to uncover.Originality: The study used two new tools designed for multilingual children to compare two 
groups of children of a recent and growing immigration group, whose language development is currently underinvestigated.Implications: The findings underscore the complexity of assessing bilingual children’s full

Introduction
In the wake of the 2004 European Union (EU) enlargement, many Western European countries have seen a rapid increase in the immigration from the former Eastern Bloc. As a result, Poland is currently the most common country of birth in the immigrant population of both Norway (Statistics Norway, 2016a) and the UK (Office for National Statistics, 2016). Migrant communities may retain their own minority language(s) at the expense of the majority language(s), maintain their minority language(s) alongside the majority language(s) or undergo a process of language shift, where the heritage language is replaced with the majority language (Fishman, 1991). As pointed out by Fishman (1991), the first two outcomes depend on intergenerational transmission of the minority language; language transmission in turn depends on language maintenance. Language shifts may vary in speed within different contexts (Gal, 1979), but they tend to progress from one generation to the next (De Houwer, 2007; Fishman, 1991; Saltarelli & Gonzo, 1977). Importantly, an individual can become or cease to be multilingual; as such, multilingualism 
must be seen as a dynamic state rather than a static property (Grosjean, 2008)."
10-1177_1368430216684646.pdf,Organiz,"Building on a range of  theoretical traditions with a leading role of  the sexual stigma conceptual framework (Herek, 2009), we propose that regulations enforced by state institutions shape political engagement of  nonheterosexual individuals by sequentially affecting internalized homophobia and in-group identification. To verify our expec -
tations, we utilize the data obtained from LGB (lesbian, gay, and bisexual) individuals living in five East European countries (Croatia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland) that differ signifi-cantly in the scope of  rights they guarantee to sexual minorities. Institutional Sexual Stigma
Despite the worldwide cultural change (Inglehart & Welzel, 2005), sexual stigma—“society’s shared belief  system through which homosexu-ality is denigrated, discredited, and constructed as invalid relative to heterosexuality” (Herek, 2009, p. 171)—still pervades our social life. The various areas of  its manifestations have been captured within the sexual stigma conceptual framework (Herek, 2009). As posited by this per -
spective, disapproval of  homosexuality may be expressed not only through the beliefs, feelings, and actions of  straight and nonheterosexual individuals, but also by social institutions. Institutional sexual stigma, also termed hetero-
sexism (Herek, 2009) or structural stigma (Hatzenbuehler, 2014), involves a set of  organiz-ing principles that either do not recognize the interests of  LGBTQI people or overtly subject this group to discrimination and denigration (Herek, 2009). Its instances differ in their severity and may be observed in various areas such as reli-gion, medicine, or law. In the present contribution, we focus on the legal aspect of  heterosexism. As pointed out by Herek (2009), legal mani-
festations of  sexual stigma may take at least three forms: (a) punishing sexual acts between two adult individuals of  the same sex (i.e., sodomy laws), (b) denying basic civil liberties to members of  sexual minorities (e.g., the “homosexual prop -
aganda” law in Russia), and (c) reinforcing the power differences between heterosexual majority and sexual minorities (e.g., the absence of  antidis-crimination laws in some European countries; International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association Europe [ILGA] Europe, 2015a, 2015b). Because such regulations effi -
ciently limit LGBs’ life opportunities, the need for change is at the core of  LGBTQI advocacy (ILGA Europe, 2015a). One may expect that heterosexist legal arrange -
ments would also translate into the activism of  sexual minorities."

Activists are individuals who engage in activities 
for the benefit of  the group or for the cause they consider important (Corning & Myers, 2002). This engagement on behalf  of  a group interest is related to individual and societal well-being (Corning & Myers, 2002; Klar & Kasser, 2009; Wilson & Musick, 1997). Activists compared with nonactivists have higher satisfaction with life; higher positive affect, personal growth, and per -
ceived meaning of  life (Klar & Kasser, 2009); and higher self-esteem (Wilson, 2000). Activism is a purposeful and change-oriented activity. Activists can be defined as people engaged in various behaviors that support social and political goals (e.g., donations, petitions, demonstrations, or acts of  civil disobedience; Klar & Kasser, 2009), and these activities are linked to community feelings and values (e.g., helping to make the world a better Expansion of the self of activists and

Abstract
Three studies were carried out in natural settings of mass gatherings to examine the interplay between activist identity and self-expansion and their relationship with willingness to engage in future collective actions. Study 1 was conducted among activists and supporters of equal rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals; Study 2 involved participants in a nationwide charity event; and Study 3 included members of a religious group. The results showed a statistically significant positive relationship between self-perceived activist identity and collective action (CA) tendency (Studies 1, 2, and 3). Moreover, the interaction between activist identity and self-expansion plays a role in predicting CA, with self-expansion related to willingness to engage in progroup behaviors when activist identity is low but not when activist identity is high (Studies 2 and 3). This interaction statistically significantly predicted collective action tendency when nonmaterialistic relational self-expansion and nonrelational self-expansion were considered but not when materialistic self-expansion was tested (Study 3).

They showed that place identity is related to out-group differentiation, in-group favoritism, and out-group devaluation. The historical sites of  Gdańsk allow its consid-
eration as an essentialist place; thus, in the present research we decided to capture Gdańsk’s essential-ist in-group continuity. Given its history, the pop-ulation of  Gdańsk and their national origins have changed; before World War II, its citizens were Germans, Poles, Kashubians, Pomeranians, and Jews. Before World War II, the city was more mul-tiethnic, and functioned as a free city yet politically dependent on Germany. After World War II, the population became ethnically homogenous, with many residents from regions incorporated into the Soviet Union. Despite the fact that, histori-cally, Gdańsk has a broken continuity (Perkowski, 2013), its inhabitants still may perceive in-group continuity by referring to the values of  openness and diversity, and to the tradition of  the port city known as the Polish window to the world during 4 Group Processes & Intergroup Relations  00(0)
the communist time. Thus, we predict that resi-
dents who experienced collective angst after the murder of  Mayor Adamowicz will perceive the Gdańsk in-group as possessing essentialist conti-nuity, regardless of  the lack of  objective signals of  such continuity in a place where the population has changed so dramatically. Social connectedness is also an important 
mechanism linking existential concerns about the future vitality of  one’s group to collective action on behalf  of  it. That is, people who feel close to their in-group fellow members are especially prone to engage in group-based actions and cooperate with others to achieve group goals. For example, people who declared closeness with a group exhibited stronger willingness to act for the group and alongside other group members (e.g., Becker & Tausch, 2015; Swann et al., 2014; 
Thomas et al., 2016)."

Abstract
Collective narcissists are hostile towards outgroup members, especially in response to threats against the ingroup. In the current study (N = 662; Polish community sample), we examined the associations between collective narcissism and intergroup relations using the agency–communion model of collective narcissism during the initial weeks of the COVID-19 threat in Poland. Assuming the COVID-19 threat is agentic (i.e., related to biological and economic danger), we expected it to be unrelated to collective narcissism’s communal aspect. We also expected that collective narcissists would enhance their ingroup image to modify the effects of the COVID-19 threat on intergroup relations. In general, collective narcissism was related to less favorable attitudes toward the European Union, more favorable attitudes toward China, and a willingness to help Italians. The agentic aspect of narcissism was unrelated to intergroup prosocialness, while the communal aspect of narcissism was unrelated to attitudes toward the European Union."

When communal collective narcissists are con-fronted with unfavorable information about ingroup friendliness, their favorable attitudes toward others vanish. In contrast, agentic collective narcissists do not manifest favorable attitudes toward others in nonthreatening condi-tions (Żemojtel-Piotrowska et al., 2021). As such, 
collective narcissism is related to the derogation of  others when narcissists are confronted with unfavorable feedback about their ingroup (Golec de Zavala et al., 2016). Yet this effect is moder -
ated by the way people enhance their group (Żemojtel-Piotrowska et al., 2021). In the current study, we examined in a sample 
of  Poles to what extent the threat posed by COVID-19 (i.e., agentic) to one’s ingroup could relate to attitudes toward China (i.e., threatening outgroup relevant to COVID-19 threat) and the European Union (i.e., threatening outgroup irrel-evant to COVID-19 threat), and how collective narcissism is associated with helping intentions towards Italy (i.e., nonthreatening outgroup in need). Collective narcissism has been shown to be related to unfavorable attitudes towards the European Union (EU) whether the samples were from former EU members (i.e., UK; Guerra et al., 2017) or from Poland (Cisłak et al., 2020). Even though Poland is a member of  the EU, national collective narcissism (i.e., narcissistic identification with the Polish nation) leads to sup-port for leaving the bloc (Cisłak et al., 2020). However, prior research indicates that only threats to ingroup status (Guerra et al., 2017) or 
attacks to an inflated ingroup image (Golec de Zavala et al., 2009) leads to outgroup derogation. In the case of  attitudes toward China, people’s perception of  threat may be different, because that country may be perceived as partially to blame for the pandemic (e.g., Kraska, 2020). On the other hand, China could be viewed as a victim of  the pandemic both in terms of  the number of  deaths and the draconian lockdown policies they endured (Hessler, 2020)."

Collective Narcissism, In-Group
Satisfaction, and Solidarity in the Face
of COVID-19

Abstract
The present study explored the antecedents of solidarity amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Given that solidarity during mass
emergencies involves the development of a social identity encompassing those facing a common fate, we examined how national
in-group satisfaction (IS, a belief that the national in-group and one’s membership in it are of high value) versus national collective
narcissism (CN, a belief that the national in-group is exceptional and entitled to privileged treatment but not sufficiently recognized
by others) predicted solidarity with those affected by the pandemic in Poland. The results of cross-sectional and dynamic analyses
from a panel study on a representative sample of Polish adults indicate that IS predicted greater COVID-19 solidarity, whereas
CN predicted reduced COVID-19 solidarity. Keywords
COVID-19, solidarity, collective narcissism, national in-group satisfaction
“Across the European Union, countries, regions and cities are
stretching out a helping hand to neighbours, helping those most
in need. This is European solidarity in action,” claims a recent
document issued by the European Commission (2020). Indeed,
the COVID-19 pandemic has inspired an outpouring of social
solidarity, in the form of help for those in need and at risk,
support for frontline workers caring for the sick, and wider
sharing of resources and expertise (Broom, 2020; Butler,
2020; Chakelian, 2020). This illustrates that mass emergencies
often produce an uptick in solidarity and prosocial behavior
(Kaniasty & Norris, 1999; Solnit, 2009; Tierney et al., 2006). At the same time, panic shopping, protests against
stay-at-home orders, xenophobia, and ostracism of health
workers have also been observed during the pandemic
(Gebrekidan, 2020; McKeever, 2020; R´ acz, 2020), suggesting
a failure of solidarity (Mawson, 2005). What factors determine solidarity in face of COVID-19?"
10-1177_1948550620977621.pdf,Union,"Using these criteria, Esping-
Andersen (1990) distinguished three types of welfare state:
Liberal, Continental, and Nordic. In the Liberal regime, decom-
modification is low and the state offers modest insurance plans
and means-tested assistance, for example, the United States and
the UK. The Continental type (originally called Conservative
Corporatist) is characterized by a moderate level of decommo-
dification, and welfare provision is limited to those who have
occupational status, for example, Germany. The Nordic type
(originally the Social–Democratic type) has a high level of
decommodification and generous universal welfare, for exam-
ple, Sweden. The original welfare state typology was extended
by recognizing that in Southern European countries, for exam-
ple, Greece, the welfare state system is highly fragmented:
These states tend to offer very generous benefits in one area but
very modest provisions in another, they lack articulated mini-
mum social protection, and there is little governmental inter-
vention in welfare provision ( Bonoli, 1997; Ferrera, 1996;
Leibfried, 1992). Furthermore, a fter the disintegration of the
Soviet Union, prominent authors suggested that the differences
between former communist and W estern European countries
were only transitional (Deac on, 1993; Esping-Andersen,1996), but it seems as if this has not turned out to be the case. An analysis conducted around 15 years after the transformation
from communism to democracy and capitalism showed that
there were still rather large differences between postcommunist
and Western countries in their welfare state structures (Fenger,
2007). Thus, the Eastern type has been added to the typology of
welfare state models. Alth ough Eastern type covers a broad
range of countries, with different levels of success in the transi-
tion from communism to democracies, the crucial here is that
they all share the past of the centrally planned economy and
broad, nearly universal welfare provision. For the postcommu-
nist countries, the typical is “residualisation of underfinanced
and institutionally fragmented, but universalist welfare states”
(Polese et al., 2014, p. 86) and associated high level of inform-
ality of welfare provision. Importantly, this typology of welfare
regimes is not simply based on theoretical considerations but
has gained support from empirical analysis (e.g., Fenger,
2007; Saint-Arnaud & Bernard, 2003)."

exemplary liberalism. According to the liberal way of think-ing, the political community citizen is free, rational, and morally autonomous. The well-being of the individual has priority over the needs of the community. By the very fact of being human, a citizen has inherent rights and freedoms that do not require justification. Liberals emphasize that societ-ies are communities of free individuals of different world views and religions. Such individuals coexist within the law and respect each other. Civil society is built to protect its members’ freedom and property and ensure their security and peaceful coexistence. According to liberals, civil soci-ety built on a liberal basis is the only way to balance the state’s power in its relations with the citizen. Most communitarian thinkers take a compromise stance 
toward liberalism, claiming that its most important achieve-ments, including first and foremost individual rights and free-doms, should be preserved, but without destroying interpersonal solidarity and social responsibility. One can use this last remark for linking philosophical disputes and our second premise."

Introduction
In the opinion of many researchers, the financial crisis that 
hit Europe in 2008 triggered a spiral of phenomena and pro-cesses that fundamentally changed Europe’s political land-scape over the past decade (Levitsky & Way, 2010; Mudde, 2011; Pytlas, 2018). The rise of populist and anti-liberal sen-timent has not bypassed Poland, the sixth largest country by population in the European Union (EU). As many observers have seen Poland as an example of a successful transforma-tion from the authoritarian communist regime to liberal democracy, the intense anti-liberal backlash visible since 2015 can surprise many observers. Furthermore, the deeper reasons for this phenomenon are still unclear. After the systemic change in 1989, the liberal doctrine 
dominated the Polish economy and social policy, accompa-nied by apparent mental change toward liberal cultural val-ues. The 2015 parliamentary elections won by the right-wing party Prawo i Sprawiedliwość (PiS; Law and Justice) sud-denly stopped this general trend. PiS took power by present-ing the election program called “Good change.” It contained a diagnosis of weaknesses of the national economy and state institutions caused, in their opinion, by the implementation of liberal dogmas regarding the state and the economy."

parenting styles, which might influence the offspring’s psycho-
pathology, was partialed out. Controlling for parenting behavior
might imply controlling for cultural influences when assuming
that culture influences parental behavior. The between-country
differences observed in this study after partialing out the covari-
ates will be interpreted accordingly. Variations in Identity-Related Risk Factors
An inspection of the descriptives showed higher variability in
some variables. Of note, identity stress was perceived as quite
high in emerging adults from France, Germany, Greece, and
Turkey. This is in accordance with studies showing high voca-
tional identity stress in emerging adults in France (Lannegrand-
Willems, Percec, & Marchal, 2015), Germany (Seiffge-Krenke
& Haid, 2012), and in many other countries suffering from
recession such as Greece (United Nation International Chil-
drens´ Emegency Fund [UNICEF] Office of Research, 2014). In contrast, the coping style of emerging adults from all seven
countries was quite uniformly characterized by high levels in
negotiating and reflection about possible solutions, showing a
good balance between the two adaptive coping styles, a finding
so far reported only for German emerging adults (Haid et al.,
2010). Despite different political, social, and family back-
grounds as well as varying stress levels, emerging adults
throughout the world use very similar strategies to cope with
identity-related stressors. More divergence has been found with
respect to emotional control, suggesting that culture-specific
standards for an open outlet of emotions also prevail (Kagitci-
basi, 2005a; Wong & Wong, 2006). Overall, coming to termswith identity-related stressors and the adaption to a “disorderly
world” (Larson, 2011) is impressive in youth from all coun-
tries. This information is important to consider when designing
culture-specific forms of intervention and treatment."

30.3% of young people with ASD used services provided by
public mental health clinics that are main institutions offer-
ing state-funded mental health support. In contrast, 55.0%
of young people with ASD used private or NGO-based ser-
vices (the latter can operate commercially or using state
funds). In Poland, mental health care is largely underfunded,

tion of private mental health services. In the present sam-
ple, 20.6% of young people with ASD used only out-of-
pocket services, while 37.7 % combined them with state-
funded services. Mental health services include also treatment ap-
proaches for the core deficits in ASD, most notably Ap-
plied Behavior Analysis therapy and Social Skills
Trainings for teaching communication and social skills
to people with ASD. There are several evidence-based
Social Skills Trainings for this population [ 39], but none
of them is available in Poland. Moreover, Clinics for
People with Autism, which are specialized facilities that
often provide Social Skills Trainings and Applied Behav-
ior Analysis treatment, are scarcely and unevenly distrib-
uted in Poland [ 30], again directing many people with
ASD to out-of-pocket services. Taken together, these re-
sults emphasize the critical importance of increasing ac-
cessibility of the psychological and psychiatric treatment
of both core and coexisting problems that affect adoles-
cents and adults with ASD."
10-1186_s12913-019-4432-3.pdf,Fund,"Moreover, the area of residence
was an important enabling factor for young people with
ASD. More than a quarter of parents indicated services
were too far away from their home. Participants from
medium cities (i.e. having 50 –200 thousand inhabitants)
were at 3 times higher risk of finding services unavailable,
compared to those living in large cities. This resembles
the broader context of specialized, ambulatory healthcare
in Poland, which is mostly located in large cities and, as a
result, less used by inhabitants of smaller cities and rural
regions [ 40]. There are 70 cities of medium size in Poland
and most of them do not have any services for individuals
with ASD funded by the National Health Fund [ 30]. The second most pronounced barrier was related to
the affordability of services. Although in Poland both
healthcare and education are predominantly public, for
the reasons outlined earlier in this discussion, many ser-
vices are available only commercially. Predictably, low-
income parents were at higher risk of facing a financial
barrier, as well as parents of young people attending in-
tegrated classes that provide fewer services than special
classes. The youngest people with ASD in the study (12 –
14 years old) were at highest risk of finding services too
expensive. This result is consistent with the finding that
the youngest people with ASD in our sample used the
greatest number of services."

Background
Lung cancer is accounting for the largest number of
cancer-related deaths in the European Union [1]. Besides
poor survival rates [1], lung cancer and lung cancer sur-
gery may cause major changes in some areas of quality of
life (QOL). For example, patients with the most frequent
form of lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC),
report a decline in physical function across six monthsafter surgery [2, 3]. Lung-cancer specific symptoms such
as pain, fatigue, dyspnea, and coughing are reported fre-
quently [3]. Additionally, there are subsets of patients who
report persistently poor QOL across months after surgery
[3]. Importantly, levels of physical QOL are significantly
associated with overall survival: A 10% decline in physical
QOL during the first six months after surgery is associated
with an 18% increased risk of death [4]."

any point during the intervention. Lifestyle This module consists of two exercises: (1)
physical activity and (2) pleasant activities, which en-
courage participants to plan and implement activities
fostering stress reduction. Users can do only one or both
of these exercises throughout the intervention.Platform
The Med-Stress intervention was built on the Iterapi Inter-
net platform [ 46], developed and administered at Linköping
University in Sweden. The platform is widely used for inter-
national research on psychological Internet-based interven-
tions. It provides professional software, secure transfer
(https protocol), and data collection and storage protection
required by local and European Union (EU) law, including
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (EU/2016/
679). All data collected during the intervention and accom-
panying assessments, including the participants ’consent
will be entered directly on the platform by participants and
automatically encrypted, coded, and stored on the Iterapi
server. Data stored will be depe rsonalized an dm a s k e d ,w i t h
access for authorized persons only. Randomization and blinding
Randomization will be carried out using an online
randomization program ( randomizer.org ). Non-stratified
block randomization with a 1:1:1:1 allocation ratio will
be used to ensure an equal number of participants in all
four study conditions (fixed blocks of 4). Participants
will not be informed about the condition to which they
are assigned, however they will not be blinded to their
allocation, as it is publicly known that this intervention
consists of four alternatives that differ in duration."

gradually in those with normal BMI (Figure 2). For type 2 diabetes, obese individuals had 
significantly higher incidence rates than those wit h normal BMI (adjusted IRR, 4.3 [95%CI,

assess effect modification by sex, age and period. Higher rates of type 2 diabetes with obesity 
were marked in those aged 11-15 years and in the la st two periods ( P< 0.01 for interaction; 
appendix Figure 3). We observed no similar associat ions between BMI categories and type 1 
diabetes (Table 2). Table 3 shows odds ratios which approximate relativ e risks here in nested case-control

2 diabetes cases and had approximately four times t he risk of incident type 2 diabetes as those 
with a normal BMI (OR,3.7 [95%CI, 3.1-4.6]; Table 3 ). Overweight and obesity were not 
similarly associated with type 1 diabetes (Table 2) . We observed no association between 
obesity and incident type 1 diabetes in analyses li mited to diabetes cases assigned after BMI

Purpose. One of the keys to identifying health problems from the holistic perspective is the knowledge of t ype D person-
ality (distressed personality). Diagnosing this personality disorder among female football players may help sports psy-chologists, coaches, parents/caregivers, and all those engaged in training new sports entrants develop guidelines on how to resolve the problem.Methods. the study involved female footballers representing a Polish Ekstraliga football club, AZS-PSW Biała Podlaska, 
and was conducted with the use of the Polish adaptation of the DS14 scale.Results. In a group of 21 footballers, 7 (33.3%) were diagnosed with t ype D personality. Besides, a negative correlation 
was noted between the level of satisfaction with playing football and one of the dimensions of t ype D personality – negative 
emotionality.Conclusions. the results of the study may be applicable in formulating practical recommendations while preparing men-
tal training programmes.Key words: distressed personality, psychology, women’s footballoriginal paperdoi: 10.1515/humo-2017-0047

type D personality (distressed personality) is a con -
struct that has been used since the 1990s to describe a specific pattern of human functioning. In its assump -
tions, it refers to the relationship between the psyche and the body. However, the relation may negatively impact health in persons having difficulty with their psychosocial functioning. the difficulties resulting from a distressed personality 
manifest themselves in three dimensions: the behav -
ioural, emotional, and cognitive one."
10-1515_humo-2017-0047.pdf,Club,"Furthermore, the authors intended to analyse the competitors satisfaction and to verify the relationship between these variables. Some studies of satisfaction measurement and stressed personality had been conducted previously, but not in a group of athletes [17–19]. the authors consider satisfaction as one of the out -
comes of being involved in sports activities which in -
crease motivation for subsequent activity and commit -ment. t he issue of getting satisfaction from playing 
football is therefore of particular interest in the context of the mentioned burdens. At the same time, it may be vital with regard to t ype D personality (since one of 
its dimensions is associated with life satisfaction). Material and methods
the study involved 21 female football players of 
the Polish Ekstraliga football club AZS-PSW Biała Pod -
laska, aged 17–32 ( M = 19.11 ± 2.81 years) who had 
practised the sport for 5–12 years. t he examined group 
comprised females whose weekly training load ranged 
8–12 hours, mean 9 hours ( M = 9.09 ± 2.51 hours). the respondents played in various positions as the group 
involved 2 goalkeepers, 4 forwarders, 6 defenders, 6 midfielders, and 3 other players who would take different positions. All of them answered questions con -
cerning their future sports career. t he majority, i.e. 16 from among 21 respondents (76.2%), declared will -
ingness to continue playing football professionally."
10-1515_humo-2017-0047.pdf,Club,"Such a situation may contribute to the development of social or gen -
eral anxiety, as well as t ype D personality, especially 
visible in one of its dimensions – social inhibition 
[28, 29]. c reating a proper parenting climate (including 
kindness and compassion, respect, understanding, pro -
viding security, support and space for activity and tak -
ing responsibility) is crucial to developing a healthy

participants indicated how strongly they felt: enthusiastic, alert, happy, excited,
and proud (PA –positive active affect); calm, peaceful, relaxed, contented, and
satisﬁed (PD –positive deactive affect); stressed, embarrassed, upset, tense, and
nervous (NA –negative active affect); and depressed, disappointed, sluggish,
bored, and sad (ND –negative deactive affect). Daily affect scores were de ﬁned as
the mean rating for the emotions in each category. Each day participants rated the eve nts that happened to them that day
using the following scale: 0 = did not occur, 1 = occurred and not important,2 = occurred and somewhat important , 3 = occurred and pretty important,
4 = occurred and extremely important. Twenty-two of these events were taken
from the Daily Events Survey (Butler et al. 1994), a survey designed to measure
the daily lives of collegians. These event s included six positive-social events
(e.g., Went out socializing with friends/date (e.g., party, dance club), six
positive-achievement (e.g., Got caught up [or ahead] in coursework or work
duties), ﬁve negative-social (e.g., Was excluded or left out by my group of
friends), and ﬁve negative-achievement (e.g ., Did poorly on schoolwork task
[e.g., test, assignment, duty]). In addition, four events representing combi-nations of social/achievement and positive/negative were created (e.g., “Had
other type of pleasant event [not listed above] with friends, family, or date ”). All of the events are described in the supplemental materials. An impact score
(mean rating) was calculated for each event category. 2.3 Compliance with instructions

INTRODUCTION
Mobile phones are now used worldwide as one of the main
information and communication technologies (ICT). In
particular, the International Telecommunication Union(ITU) emphasized that Europe has the highest penetrationrate worldwide ( ITU World Telecommunication/ICT Indi-
cators Database, 2015 ). In the early 2000s, mobile phones
were limited to calls and text/picture messaging. However,contemporary smartphones support various other functions,
including (but not limited to) e-mailing and Internet access,
short-range wireless communication, gaming, gambling,business, social networking, watching TV shows, photog-raphy, or geo-localization. Mobile phones have become themost used technology in human history. Currently, there are2.08 billion users of 4G networks worldwide, and more than
5 billion are anticipated by 2019 ( Statista: The Statistics
Portal, 2016 ). According to international reports ( ITU
World Telecommunication/ICT Indicators Database,2015 ;The Internet World Stats, 2016 ), the penetration rate
of mobile communication currently approaches 100% inmany countries, although there are major differences among
some regions (e.g., the mobile broadband penetration rate in
Africa remains below 20%)."
10-1556_2006-6-2017-020.pdf,Fund,"Consequently, further stud-
ies are thus required to psychometrically establish the
cultural invariance of the short version of the PMPUQused in this study. Future cross-cultural research into PMPU needs to
address issues to improve methodological shortcomingsnoted in this study (e.g., cross-national comparison andimproved psychometric instruments in cultural adaptation
questionnaires), as well as patterns of PMPU (e.g., number
of apps downloaded, number of groups in WhatsApp ,
etc. ), and concurrent individual and contextual factors(e.g., substance use and social support). This study empha-sized for the need of improved knowledge concerning theuse and misuse of mobile phones in young European adults,
and also identi ﬁed speci ﬁc risk factors for self-reported
dependence, which opens up new avenues in terms ofimproved prevention practices and evidence-based regula-tion policies at the public health level. Funding sources: This study was supported by the European
Commission ( “Tech Use Disorders ”; FP7-PEOPLE-2013-

10-1556_2006-8-2019-11.pdf,Union,"Moreover, there are clear cases of death due to overwork,
and the analysis of circumstances leading to such fatalities
shows not only lack of effort to reduce work but also special
actions to increase the amount of work. For example, there arecases of Polish medical doctors who die during hospital duty,typically after more than 24 hr of continuous work. In orderto be able to work so much, they have to establish theirown business and work as an external contractor to circum-
vent work regulations ( Og´olnopolski Zwi ązek Zawodowy
Lekarzy, 2017 ). There are likely factors related to the disad-
vantageous medical policies, working environment, and/orlimited number of physicians that contribute to this situation.However, ﬁnally, an individual needs to make consecutive
decisions leading to an undue high amount of work andeventually to death (despite knowledge of physiological
consequences of extreme stress and fatigue). While substance
use disorders are well-known and persistent problems amongphysicians –often developed in response to paramount stress
and responsibility ( Domino et al., 2005 )–there is very little
known on how vulnerable individuals may react to demand-ing and unfavorable working conditions by developing
work addiction. What is acknowledged though, by Doctors ’
Trade Union of Poland ( Og´olnopolski Zwi ązek Zawodowy
Lekarzy, 2017 ) and the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour
and Welfare, is that physicians die due to long working hours(Hiyama & Yoshihara, 2008 ;Uehata, 2005 ). However, there
is a distinction between working too hard because the indi-vidual feels that is what the job demands and being addicted
to work (which will have completely different motivations). Future studies would be likely to provide more insight
into the motivational determinants of overloading oneselfwith work. More speci ﬁcally, motives that distinguish
healthy engagement and passion from unhealthy compul-sion should be investigated ( Andreassen, Ursin, & Eriksen,
2007 ;Burke & Fiskenbaum, 2009 ;Grifﬁths, 2011 ;
Sussman, 2018 ;Vallerand, 2015 ;Van den Broeck et al.,
2011 ), as well as those concerning situational factors that
may burden individuals with excessive workload andresponsibility, and in which cases the excessive work mighthave little to do with addiction. One such example concernsthe motivations characterizing workers who give in to the
excessive demands of work during an economic crisis
(Kondo & Oh, 2010 ). Arguably, in many cases, these
motivations are rooted in the basic human physical andsafety needs and have nothing to do with addiction but couldbe just as disruptive and/or destructive in an individual ’s
health status (e.g., effects of stress) and social relationships
(e.g., impact on family interactions).Withdrawal symptoms are generally understudied in
behavioral addictions ( Kaptsis, King, Delfabbro, & Gradisar,
2016 )."

and the analysis of circumstances leading to such fatalities
shows not only lack of effort to reduce work but also special
actions to increase the amount of work. For example, there arecases of Polish medical doctors who die during hospital duty,typically after more than 24 hr of continuous work. In orderto be able to work so much, they have to establish theirown business and work as an external contractor to circum-
vent work regulations ( Og´olnopolski Zwi ązek Zawodowy
Lekarzy, 2017 ). There are likely factors related to the disad-
vantageous medical policies, working environment, and/orlimited number of physicians that contribute to this situation.However, ﬁnally, an individual needs to make consecutive
decisions leading to an undue high amount of work andeventually to death (despite knowledge of physiological
consequences of extreme stress and fatigue). While substance
use disorders are well-known and persistent problems amongphysicians –often developed in response to paramount stress
and responsibility ( Domino et al., 2005 )–there is very little
known on how vulnerable individuals may react to demand-ing and unfavorable working conditions by developing
work addiction. What is acknowledged though, by Doctors ’
Trade Union of Poland ( Og´olnopolski Zwi ązek Zawodowy
Lekarzy, 2017 ) and the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour
and Welfare, is that physicians die due to long working hours(Hiyama & Yoshihara, 2008 ;Uehata, 2005 ). However, there
is a distinction between working too hard because the indi-vidual feels that is what the job demands and being addicted
to work (which will have completely different motivations). Future studies would be likely to provide more insight
into the motivational determinants of overloading oneselfwith work. More speci ﬁcally, motives that distinguish
healthy engagement and passion from unhealthy compul-sion should be investigated ( Andreassen, Ursin, & Eriksen,
2007 ;Burke & Fiskenbaum, 2009 ;Grifﬁths, 2011 ;
Sussman, 2018 ;Vallerand, 2015 ;Van den Broeck et al.,
2011 ), as well as those concerning situational factors that
may burden individuals with excessive workload andresponsibility, and in which cases the excessive work mighthave little to do with addiction. One such example concernsthe motivations characterizing workers who give in to the
excessive demands of work during an economic crisis
(Kondo & Oh, 2010 ). Arguably, in many cases, these
motivations are rooted in the basic human physical andsafety needs and have nothing to do with addiction but couldbe just as disruptive and/or destructive in an individual ’s
health status (e.g., effects of stress) and social relationships
(e.g., impact on family interactions).Withdrawal symptoms are generally understudied in
behavioral addictions ( Kaptsis, King, Delfabbro, & Gradisar,
2016 )."

10-2147_prbm-s266511.pdf,Club,"It may suggest that the PEP students 
are much better at dealing with the difficult situation 
caused by the coronavirus quarantine, that ENG group. Our research is consistent with growing evidence in the 
scientific literature that physical activity (in particular 
aerobic exercises, such as running or cycling) modulates 
hormones, amino acids, and neurotransmitters levels, 
decreasing psychological stress and alleviating depression 
and anxiety .15 Recent research indicates that an active 
lifestyle with an appropriate level of exercise and healthy 
dietary habits can affect immune aging positively .17 
Maintaining a high level of physical activity with age 
may improve many features of immunosenescence.14 
A recent review showed that increasing the aerobic capa-
city could improve immune competence, which fulfills the 
protective role against COVID-19, decreasing its 
severity .16 The mechanism of improving immunity based 
on 1) increasing the function of immune cells and immu -
noglobulins regulating CRP levels and lead to decrease 
anxiety and depression; 2) improving the respiratory sys-
tem and restoring lung tissue elasticity and strength; 3) 
decreasing COVID-19 risk factors. However , Zhang et al13 showed that satisfaction with 
life is negatively associated with hours of exercise among 
working adults in China one month into the COVID-19 
outbreak. Those individuals who exercised a lot (above 2.5 
hours per day) were less satisfied than suggests that they 
might be more frustrated by the restrictions due to the 
outbreak. First of all, everyday physical training lasting 
more than 2.5 hours may be very aggravating and indicate 
rather an exercise addiction, which is related to insomnia and also dissatisfaction, irritation, and fear if the routine is 
changed. Most of the people do physical exercise outside 
the home, in beautiful surroundings among nature or with 
other people in the fitness club, gym hall, or playground. A diverse environment and meetings with a team of 
players are as important (or even more) as physical activ -
ity. Home-based physical training can be limited and bor-
ing, and thus may increase frustration and angry . Impact of Coronavirus-Related Health on 
Anxiety , Stress, General Health, and 
Satisfaction with Life
A high level of stress and anxiety may be interpreted as 
a consequence of fear for health during the COVID-19 
pandemic outbreak, as it was evidenced in ANOV A out-
comes in this study . The most significant differences were 
found between groups that feel much better during coro-
navirus quarantine, and those that rated their general health 
as much worst now in comparison to situation before 
COVID-19 outbreak, regards anxiety (effect size was ηp2 
= 0.14), perceived stress (effec t size was ηp2 = 0.12), and 
emotion-oriented coping style (effect size was ηp2 = 0.09). The other group’ s differences in life satisfaction and 
avoidance coping style are significant at p-value < 0.001 
but may have marginal importance since effect size are 
very poor (ηp2 was between 0.01 and 0.03)."

BacKGround : a high level of motor coordination (with an emphasis on the accuracy of hand movements) is an important part of fencers’  
training. research on motor coordination shows that both hemispheres of the brain are involved in controlling the action of each of the upper 
limbs. As the physical training of one hand is believed to significantly increase the performance of the other (untrained) hand, the authors at -
tempt to verify the hypothesis that specialized training of the non-dominant limb can improve the performance of the dominant hand in fencing. METHODS: The study was carried out in Poznań, Poland, in 2015 and involved the experimental (N.=8) and control (N.=8) groups of cadets 
(12.7±0.5 years old); body mass 38.69±4.08; body height 153.47±6.17), who were randomly selected from fencers belonging to the fencing 
Club “Warta” in Poznań, Poland. Participants in the study belonged to one training group with a similar training experience of about 6 years. All participants in the study (N.=16) declared right-handedness during trainings and duels. Their right lateralization was also confirmed in a 
survey, which was conducted using the edinburgh Questionnaire. The experimental training program included six weeks of specialized training 
of the coordination skills of the non-dominant side. It was carried out five times a week."

Dictator Game and a chosen distraction task, i.e., information
about the possible loss of money, could have activated actions
focused on satisfying self-interest. Then people considered the
information that the participants had performed fewer tasks then
their partners and tended to give them more money. Information
about partners ﬁlling out more questionnaires then could lead
to the application of cooperative heuristics and to giving more
money to the partners.The participants were supposed to become acquainted with
the instructions and the scale in the ﬁrst 10 s. We consider this
a limitation of the interpretation of the study’s results, as some
participants might have processed the information beforehand. Therefore even during reading the instructions the participants
were distracted (the ﬂickering of the screen and the information
about the time pressure). In Study 2 a training task was added
to avoid the diﬀerences in the time length between the groups
caused by their becoming acquainted with the procedure. STUDY 2
Recent polls that were conducted in Poland show that the
proportion of people declaring prejudice against Jews (the ethnic
minority, not the religious group) is decreasing (Maliszewski,
2011). This could be partially the result of the more widespread
norm of political correctness and internalization of egalitarian
values. Hence, the declared attitude may be the result of inference
about Jews on the basis of the respondents’ values and norms. When the cognitive resources of an individual are limited, it is
diﬃcult to take into account the overall situation and decide what
is and what is not incorrectly assessed. In such situations the most
automatic processes are selected. Their source may exist in the
memory patterns of associations, i.e., introspectively unidentiﬁed
(or inaccurately identiﬁed) traces of a past experience, thus
implicit attitudes."

studies on DG were often conducted among participants from
diﬀerent cultures (Henrich et al., 2001; Gurven, 2004). Thus,
we wanted to expand the generalizability of our ﬁndings by
investigating whether patterns in sharing various goods are
culturally independent. MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
To test the cross-cultural pattern of economic behaviors
performed in DG with diﬀerent types of goods involved,
we collected data among people who function daily
under the conditions of low market integration (Tsimane’
forager-horticulturists – Amazonian Indians) and in a society
highly integrated with the market-based economy (Poland). Tsimane’ are a forager-horticulturists population of 8000
people scattered around a 100 villages in the region of Maniqui
River (Huanca, 2006). Their level of integration with Bolivian
economy, culture and society varies from a fairly traditionalway of living (high isolation, performing shifting cultivation,
hunting, ﬁshing, and plant foraging) to relative integration (i.e.,
formal education, inhabiting settlements that can be reached by
road, being regularly employed and relying on wages) (Godoy
et al., 2010; Godoy, 2012). Poland is a country in Central Europe
with a GDP of about 15,000 US$ per capita in 2015 (World
Bank, 2016) and is a part of the European Union. It represents
a modern industrialized society highly integrated with market
economy. The study was conducted among 109 Tsimane’ , of whom 59
were females aged between 15 and 40 ( MD26.2, SDD6.8) and
50 were males aged between 18 and 40 ( MD28.3, SDD6.5). Tsimane’ participants were recruited among people living in four
villages along the Maniqui River – Campo Bello, Las Palmas,
Uasichi and Las Minas. These villages are located in similar
proximity to the nearest town (approximately 3 h by canoe). Their inhabitants rely on foraging and small-scale agriculture,
and only occasionally visit the town in order to sell surplus food
products and purchase goods such as sugar and oil."

INTRODUCTION
Substantial research on organizational justice attests to people being keenly attuned to matters of
justice in their workplace ( Brockner, 2016 ). Notably, many researchers emphasize that fairness
is not an objective concept but rather a psychological eﬀect, co nstructed by the recipient of the
procedure ( van den Bos, 2005 ). Thus, recent approaches to organizational justice have focu sed
on the nature of the mental shortcuts used in forming and applyin g psychological judgments of
fairness: the so-called fairness heuristics (Cropanzano et al., 2001 ). In this paper we consider the
principle of regulatory ﬁt (Higgins, 2000 ) as another potential contributor to employees’ fairness
judgments about organizational conduct; speciﬁcally, the ﬁ t between employee’s self-regulatory
focusandtheregulatoryfocusoftheirorganization. When performing tasks at work, individuals have preferred goal -pursuit strategies (e.g., John
prefers to make decisions quickly ) while at the same time they need to deal with the more or lessRoczniewska et al. Person-Organization Fit and Justice
formal rules that have been established in their companies
regarding which strategies should be used in goal pursuit (e. g.,
John’s company urges the employees to be careful and consider
diﬀerent options prior to making a decision in order not to ma ke
a mistake )."
10-3389_fpsyg-2017-02318.pdf,Organiz,"The participants in each condition were asked to
provide descriptions for all three events. This general techni que
forinducingregulatoryfocusbyhavingparticipantsrecallc ertain
events from the past has been previously validated in numerous
studies (e.g., Higgins et al., 1994; Liberman et al., 2001; Cesario
etal.,2004 ). Organizationaljustice
For the purpose of higher external validity ( Wojciszke, 2004 ),
we used a diﬀerent justice perception instrument. The perceived
fairness of organizational conduct was measured using a newly -
developed scale that consists of 5 items (e.g., “I consider the
conductinmyworkplacefair”; Roczniewska,2016 ).Participants
are asked to answer using a scale ranging from 1 (deﬁnitely
not) to 5 (deﬁnitely yes). The Cronbach’s alpha coeﬃcient
for the scale’s reliability was α=0.95. In validation studies
this instrument correlated highly with Colquitt’s organiz ational
justice scales ( r=0.84,p<0.001), supporting its validity
(Roczniewska,2016 ). Employee’sself-regulatoryfocus
Similarly to Study 1, we applied Work Regulatory Focus
Scale (Neubert et al., 2008 ) to measure the level of chronic
promotion ( α=0.81) and prevention ( α=0.81) foci from
the perspective of an individual. By subtracting each individ ual’s
prevention focus score from that individual’s promotion scor e,
we obtained a continuous focusvariable with values ranging

from−2.11 to 2.67 ( M= −0.34,SD=0.67). Values below 0
indicate a predominant prevention focus, whereas values abov e
0 indicate a predominant promotion focus (see, for example,
CesarioandHiggins,2008 ). Results and Discussion

errors. In line with the results obtained by other authors (e .g.,
Moser et al., 2013 ), a higher level of BIS is more typical
for apprehension anxiety as it is more associated with error
monitoring than arousal anxiety. Obviously, both types of
anxiety revealed a higher BIS level than individuals low on
both arousal and apprehension anxiety. In addition, as BIS goe s
with fear, anxiety, frustration, and sadness ( Gray, 1981 ), it was
not surprising that it was higher in valence depression than in
anhedonicdepressionandinlowvalencedepression. Finally, signiﬁcant diﬀerences were found for the level of
BAS and BAS-related scales: BAS Drive, BAS Fun Seeking, and
BAS Reward Responsiveness in scoring higher on anhedonic
depression compared to low anhedonic-depressive and valence-
depressive. It is explained by the fact that low BAS is associat ed
with anhedonia, i.e., with diﬃculties in goal achievement,
impossibility to experience pleasure, and failure in deliverin g
suﬃcientrewardfollowingapproachbehaviors. It should also be added that the stability of all scales of the
ADQasmeasuredbythetest-retesttechniqueissatisfactor y. Certain limitations of our study should be noted. First
relates to the self-reported data that could be associated
with several potential sources of bias and requires replicatio n
and conﬁrmation with experimental procedures. Second, these
studiesweretimeconsuminganddemandingfortheparticipant s.
Thus, a possibility existed that they clicked through the
questionnaires without much reﬂection (although it seemed
that the number of such participants was not especially high,
and we tried to exclude these cases from analyses). Third,
in statistical techniques like Cronbach’s αor factor analysis
(CFA), high parameter values sometimes indicated redundanc y
in scales."

advertised using the opposite mechanism – if the product was
advertised to the ﬁrst group using product placement, in the
second it was done so using a traditional commercial spot. After watching the material, study participants were shown a
board composed of 88 logos (10 distractors – products from
the same category as a product visible in the material –
for each brand) and asked to indicate eight of them that
appeared in the ﬁlm. All participants were carefully informed
about the whole study procedure and were asked to sign

(in pre-study and in main experiment) was developed in
cooperation with the Institutional Review Board (Komisja Etyki

University of Social Sciences and Humanities, and after thorough
consideration of the beneﬁts and risks associated with conducting
the experiment the Board gave its approval (Decision number

On the basis of the obtained results, four brands were identiﬁed
which were visible by all or nearly all participants (90–100%),
and two new ﬁlms were prepared using them. Material containing
product placement was composed of: product placement for thebrand Coca-Cola used in the TV series Breaking Bad , product
placement for the brand Starbucks used in the ﬁlm Fight Club,
product placement of the brand Pizza Hut used in the TV
series House of Cards , and product placement of the brand
Dr Pepper used in the ﬁlm Spiderman. The second material
contained traditional commercials for these brands, in the same
order. A new board was also prepared with logos for measuring
the participants’ recall; this time it was composed of 44 brands
(analogically, 10 distractors were assigned to each brand of
products representing the same category). The materials used in
the study are available as an online supplement to this article; they
may also be made available on request. Participants in both the pre-study and the main study were
students (and thus young adults with an average age of around
25 years old). This choice was driven by the particular approach
of young people to brands and their large inﬂuence on purchasing
decisions they make (Feltham, 1998)."
10-3389_fpsyg-2018-01519.pdf,Union,"Diﬀerent countries around the world have diﬀerent
approaches in law to the time that can be devoted to commercials. Under the Australian ""Commercial Television Industry Code
of Practice"" it cannot exceed 13 min in the course of an hour
(approximately 22%) between 6 p.m. and 12 p.m., while in the
remaining broadcast time it may not exceed 15 min (25%). In
the United States, the amount of broadcast time given over to
commercials has signiﬁcantly increased over the last 50 years. For example, in the 1960s a screening of ""The Wizard of Oz"" took
2 h (with 101 min of time for the ﬁlm itself); today it lasts 2.5 h
or even longer (Freim, 2013). This forces some broadcasters to
shorten the ﬁlm itself to ﬁt all the advertisements in. In turn, a
report published in 2013 by the European Broadcasting Union
(EBU) shows that within Europe there are signiﬁcant diﬀerences
in the amount of TV airtime devoted to commercials. In some
Scandinavian countries (Norway, Sweden, Finland) there are no
commercials broadcast at all on public television. The same is
true in the United Kingdom and Belgium. In turn, Polish public
television devotes the largest amount of airtime in Europe to
commercials – 18.34%. When combined with time spent on
previews of upcoming programming (1.81%) the total exceeds
20%. However, does such a heavy saturation of programming
with advertising content lead directly to the success of the
companies hawking their products, or at least to their brands
being remembered?"

INTRODUCTION
We can observe many wars and military interventions ongoing throughout the world in recent
years. The global list of violent conﬂicts is long, including around 50 conﬂicts involving more than
60 countries and at least 370 guerrilla groups (Peace Research Institute Oslo [PRIO], 2017; Uppsala
Conﬂict Data Program [UCDP], 2017), and in 2017 alone these conﬂicts resulted in the deaths of
more than 200,000 people. The Fragile States Index (Fund for Peace, 2017) is a scale of the military
threat that a country faces and indicates that almost 125 countries are at risk of war. Although policymakers inﬂuence public attitudes, military intervention can only be carried out
when there is support for, or acceptance of war at least in democracies (Foyle, 2004). Many studies
have found that the speciﬁc beliefs in a given culture are connected with government policy –
e.g., societal cynicism, which represents a generalized belief that the social system and institutions
of a society are hostile toward its members (Bond et al., 2004; Stavrova and Ehlebracht, 2015). Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 1 January 2019 | Volume 9 | Article 2645fpsyg-09-02645 January 14, 2019 Time: 15:34 # 2

Such ﬁndings indicate that attitudes and beliefs can aﬀect people’s
willingness to engage in war-related behaviors. On the other
hand, persistently high military spending may also contribute
to such willingness."

OR = 0.94). Measures
Coping Strategies
Four kinds of coping strategies with health problems were
analyzed twice: brooding, reﬂection, co-rumination, and positive
reappraisal. Brooding (e.g., “ I think ‘Why do I have health
problems other people don’t have’ ”) and reﬂection (e.g., “ I think
about why I feel this way ”) were measured using the Polish
version of four Ruminative Response Styles items (RRS) (Treynor
et al., 2003; Whitmer and Gotlib, 2011) specially modiﬁed for
this study (the instruction and items referred to the somatic and
health problems in the last week). Co-rumination (e.g., “ When
I talk with someone I tell him/her every detail about my health
problems ”) was measured using two modiﬁed (in the manner as
above) Co-Rumination Questionnaire (CRQ) items (Rose, 2002;
Davidson et al., 2014). Positive reappraisal (e.g., “ I’ve been trying
to see it in a diﬀerent light, to make it seem more positive. ”)
was measured using the Polish version of two items from the
abbreviated situational version of COPE (Brief COPE) (Carver,
1997)."

INTRODUCTION
The most prevalent type of cancer among women is breast cancer, which represents 25% of
cancers in women with an estimated number of over 1.7 million new diagnoses each year (World
Cancer Research Fund International, 2012). Moreover, advances in cancer treatment have led to
“survivability rates” that can reach almost 90% (American Cancer Society, 2016). This means that
although survivability rates can vary widely as a function of the location and type of cancer and the
stage when it is diagnosed, the trend is such that many women are living with the disease for longer
periods of time than in the past. In this sense, breast cancer is being transformed from a fatal illness
into a chronic condition. Although modern science has found ways to treat the physical disease of breast cancer, the
negative psychological outcomes of breast cancer have received less attention, and such negative
outcomes are quite common. Some estimates suggest that 85% of breast cancer survivors suﬀer
from PTSD symptoms (Bulotien ˙e and Matuizienë, 2014) and up to 25% are depressed (National
Cancer Institute, 2013)."

We used the same four items used in previous studies to

(a= 0.94). Since in this study we have a suﬃcient sample size to

to verify with this technique that the items used to measure

MEPREPA intervention (an abbreviation of “me preparo”/I am
ready MEtas, Preguntar, Escuchar, Preguntar para Aclarar/aim s,
asking questions, listening, asking to receive explanation s), in a
group of Latino/a families, Stein et al. (2017) show that parental
stress probably leads to a low self-eﬃcacy that contributes t o
low activation of parents in seeking mental health services f or
their children with ADHD symptoms. As a result, parents can
be less eﬀective in providing their child with access to necess ary
assistance, and less optimistic in perceiving their abilities to
support beneﬁcial changes. The results of the trial show that
parents with more symptoms of depression and a higher level
of stress beneﬁted more from the MEPREPA as compared to the
control group (support group). Furthermore, the intervention

also characterized by certain recurring limitations, indi cating

scale of migration that concerns parents and children, and to
the potentially crucial role of PSE in promoting mental health . Further research with more diverse immigrant groups and a
widerrangeofreceivingculturesisdeﬁnitelyrequired. Implications for Clinical Practice and
Therapy
The analyzed studies contain many implications for clinical
practice and therapy. One of the main issues is stress associat ed
with migration, which is a strong risk factor for dysfunctio ns in
families ( Smokowski et al., 2008; Kiang et al., 2017 ). Therefore,
knowledge about the acculturation process (e.g., a directio n of
its orientation, level of acculturation, a parent-child con ﬂict)
in immigrant parents may help to identify people at risk of
decreasedparentingself-eﬃcacy,andthus,possibly,alsoofl ower
indices of mental health and parental adaptation ( Costigan and

face challenges associated with involvement in the new cult ure
are at a higher risk of using less eﬀective parenting practices
(Costigan and Koryzma, 2011 ). It is important to encourage
immigrant parents to search for a form of support suitable for
their needs (independent of or related with the promotion of
biculturality).Nationalandlocalprogramsarerequired,f ocusing

when we have concerns about the question comprehension, we
randomly ask the same questions twice. As we had no doubts
that the Hadza understood the task of the present study, we did
not perform such checking techniques. Nevertheless, this can be
regarded as a potential limitation of the present study (and in
general, many other studies conducted among the traditional,
illiterate populations). Another possible limitation of the present ﬁndings is that, due
to the small samples, recruiting techniques, and lack of extensive
information regarding participants from both populations, ﬁnal
samples do not necessarily represent well the whole societies
they derive from (i.e., Polish and Hadza). Similarly, we chose
Hadza and Poles as representatives of traditional and modern
societies, having no certainty that Poles are indeed typical for all
non-Western countries and Hadza do not necessarily represent
all hunter-gatherer cultures. Nevertheless, Poles do present a
modern, industrialized way of living and as members of European
Union are strongly bonded with and inﬂuenced by other cultures
of the West. Yet, one needs to bear these in mind when
interpreting the results of the present study. We would also like to note the fact that some of our statistical
decisions may be considered suboptimal. In the ﬁrst study we
merged two categories of answers, namely “sad” and “sometimes
happy and sometimes sad” into one category. We acknowledge
that this decision might be considered problematic, but because
we were interested in “happiness, ” it made sense to dichotomize
our participants into those who considered themselves “happy”
vs. the rest. In the second study, we did not test for invariance in
each group (i.e., Poles and Hadza) separately."

Participants
The participants in this study were 5 women and 5 men, each of
whom had experienced severe mental illness and had a medical
diagnosis of schizophrenia. At the time of the interview, six
of them were patients in an outpatient psychiatric clinic in
Warsaw, which represents an urban mental health institution
within a public health system. One participant was a member
of a patients’ club at the clinic, and another was a member of
a support group for individuals with mental illnesses associated
with the clinic. The last two participants were members of
social networks comprised of prior participants of this study. All participants were under ongoing care of psychological and
psychiatric professionals and received medical and, in some cases,
psychological treatment. No participant was in the acute stage
of his or her illness at the time of the study, but all had earlier
in-patient experiences. The mean age of participants was 34.4
(SD= 6.07). Three persons had higher education, ﬁve had a
secondary education, and two had vocational education."

could act as a limitation in the case of male participants, but
an advantage for female participants, who may in turn feel safer
while expressing their sexual experiences. In the interviews with
male participants, the motif of sexuality was narratively linked
with awareness of their low social status. This evoked the theme
of competition with other men. Participants also spoke about
diﬃculties in managing jealousy. For example, Jack says that his 2-week-long love “vanished”
and that he would rather “it better not come back.” For him,
love is associated with risks and aggression, both expressed and
experienced. When the object of his aﬀection chose another
man—also a patient—at a club, Jack reacted with aggression
toward both of them, for which he was thrown out of the club:
“Yeah, she went to fuck another guy. She was dating me. So, being
the clever guy I am, I whooped her ass and bid her good night. So
they threw me out of the club. Banned me for 3 months.”
His thoughts about a future relationship are colored by
suspicions that the partner would cheat on him. Therefore, he
sums it all up with the saying: “ Love is a feeling that’s dumb, it
ends in tears, it ends on your bum”."

in the narratives of longer-suﬀering respondents stands in
contrast to the stories of more-recently diagnosed participants. The latter focus on their ideals—long-term, harmonious, loving
relationships with women. Those are the relationships which they
seek and dream of, despite having experienced plenty of rejection."

parents of children with ASD is the lack of adequate professional support [ 7]. It has also been found
that the delay in attending to the parents’ initial concerns, the diagnostic delay and not accompanying
the diagnosis (even if it is early) with concrete guidelines for the intervention, increases the parents’
stress [8]. Despite the high and increasing prevalence of ASD and the personal and family costs of autism,
these disorders have received little attention in the European public health services ﬁeld (and in the rest
of the world). The personal and family characteristics mentioned above have important implications in
terms of planning and prioritizing healthcare, educational and social services. In order to promote the
development of more appropriate strategies aimed at improving the response to autism, the European
Parliament adopted in 2015 the Written Declaration on Autism, calling for a European strategy for
autism that supports accurate detection and diagnosis across Europe and promote evidence-based
interventions for children with autism. The Directorate-General for Health and Food Safety (DG
Santé) of the European Commission agreed to fund Autism Spectrum Disorders in the European
Union (ASDEU) project [ 9] whose efforts, within Work Package 2, are speciﬁcally aimed at promoting
successful early detection and evidence-based early intervention for people with autism and their
families in the European context. Thus, the general objective of this literary review is to describe the different screening procedures,
as well as early intervention programmes for ASD reported in scientiﬁc publications based on European
experiences, placing more emphasis on contextual factors. As a speciﬁc objective, a description of the
advantages and disadvantages of different screening experiences will be provided (both test-based
screening programmes as well as developmental surveillance programmes and other observational
measures for this purpose) with the ultimate purpose of examining their impact within the context in
which they are applied. In addition, this review will also give account of the different programmes
and practices of early intervention for ASD and will describe the different characteristics or knowledge
that has been obtained from applying them in public or private settings. This paper is structured as follows: Sections 2 and 3 presents the screening programme topic and
Sections 4 and 5 the early intervention subject. A ﬁnal Section 6 has been added to conclude with the
integration of information about both topics."
10-3390_brainsci7120159.pdf,Union,"The implementation of in-class intervention also shows positive results, as well as training
of typically developing children in comprehensive social skills that would facilitate the social and
communicative behaviours of their peers with ASD [40,41]. Although high-intensity comprehensive treatments have been associated with positive
intervention results, procuring studies that investigate the effectiveness of such programmes in
reducing ASD symptoms and improving the core deﬁcits associated with the disorder is more common
than ﬁnding scientiﬁc work studying low-intensity programs. However, just as comprehensive
treatments have positive intervention results, so do focused intervention practices, as suggested in [ 56],
which evaluate the social-communicative effects of the Picture Exchange Communication System
(PECS) in treating children with ASD. In this study children were assessed pre- and post-intervention
and the ﬁndings indicate that even though there were no signiﬁcant group differences in standardized
tests scores at baseline (T1), post treatment outcomes (T2) show signiﬁcant improvement on the VABS
social-domain and social communicative abilities [ 47]. Moreover, an ongoing study investigating the
efﬁcacy of focused interventions [ 9] found a positive correlation between the time of treatment and
intervention effectiveness, which supports the notion that the higher the intensity of the intervention
the better outcomes achieved. Although the replication and implementation of comprehensive and focused programmes in
countries of the European Union has shown positive results [ 40,57], according to a literature review
conducted under the ASDEU project [ 9] not many studies have proposed the development and
implementation of a European comprehensive and/or focused programme, except for The Scottish
Centre for Autism Preschool Treatment Programme (SCA). This treatment curriculum, run by a tertiary
service within the Department of Child and Family Psychiatry at Yorkhill Hospital, Scotland, has a
social-developmental approach and follows a well-structured curriculum, as it is supervised by the
programme’s creators, its daily organization is arranged by a programme coordinator and is integrated
by a multidisciplinary team of therapists (nursery nurses, teachers, occupational therapists, speech
and language therapists) all well-trained in the programme’s therapeutic approach [ 55]. Moreover,
a study conducted to examine the effectiveness of the treatment suggested that having access to
this intervention resulted in positive outcomes for children with ASD, since children receiving the
intervention signiﬁcantly improved in the measures of social interaction, imitation, daily living skills,
joint attention and adaptive behaviours [45]. Yet, with regard to the subject of ASD early intervention, two aspects must be carefully evaluated:
(1) the proﬁle of the professionals and their training in ASD; and (2) the perspective of family members
regarding the intervention, such as access to treatment, how the intervention is administered, its
duration and post intervention results. In light of the poor data on these two aspects, work package
2 of the ASDEU project [ 9] launched two surveys within the European union context, one for

these surveys indicates that the geographical location of the intervention centres is one of the most
important elements to be taken into account to reduce treatment delay, as the time it takes to get to
these centres is often one of the main challenges families face when accessing treatment services [ 9]. Furthermore, another limitation stressed by participants is the facilities where early interventions
take place. Those responding to the surveys also emphasized the importance of better informing
the families about the disorder and also pointed out how relevant it is for professionals working
directly with individuals with ASD to have proper training. Additionally, these ﬁndings indicate
the common view that there should be a shared effort to bring ASD awareness and to promote early
intervention coordination, proposing intervention guidelines for different age groups and establish
and well-deﬁned procedure."

intervention tools and programmes. However, political authorities, parent organizations, professionals
and researchers alike also have a responsibility to support, promote and conduct controlled studies
that can later be transferred from these controlled contexts to clinical practice, within the framework of
protocols protected by public policies that acknowledge the needs of the families of children with ASD
and that provide the public services with the required resources to coordinate and evaluate the efforts
for early ASD identiﬁcation and intervention, for the sake of young children with ASD. Finally, it must be highlighted that the search conducted for this review has mainly focused in
European studies and thus, it is important to note and acknowledge that there is a copious amount of
international research on screening and early intervention programme, which could without a doubt be
useful within the European context. However, examining this concept was out of the scope of this study. Further, more research should be devoted to the investigation and comparison of screening and early
interventions practices from other international backgrounds with the objective of testing feasibility
and exploring other good practices to be applied not only in European contexts but anywhere else. Acknowledgments: The authors were supported by a research grant awarded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy

1. Introduction
Overweightness and obesity have become widespread phenomena whose prevalence is increasing
in most countries throughout the world [ 1]. Obesity can be a cause of chronic illness [ 2–4] or even
death [ 5,6] and is observed in both rich communities and in and in those characterized by low or
moderate incomes [7]. According to Eurostat research from 2017 [ 8], 51.6% of the European population is overweight or
obese. Unfortunately in Poland, the proportion of people with obesity or overweight is 53.3% and is
therefore above the average for 28 countries from the European Union [9]. Due to the physiological changes in the organism the frequency of obesity is proportionally greater
among older people [ 10]. The increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity in elderly is especially
associated with many psychophysical health problems and increased mortality. Therefore there is
a need to apply various public health interventions to reduce the high prevalence of overweight and
obesity among elderly population so that they can lead a socially secure life. Many factors cause obesity . Both the roles of biophysical factors (e.g., genetics or hormones) [11–13] ,
and environmental factors [ 14] are frequently discussed."

not qualify for further analysis did not complete the psychological tests for various reasons and did
not complete the study (for example, due to deterioration of health during the test, or because they did
not apply for the test). 3.2. Characteristics of the Study Group
Purposive sampling was used in selecting the study group participants. The criteria for selection
to the clinical group included sex (female), breast cancer diagnosis, and completed mastectomy
(partial or total, the latter involving the loss of both breasts). Each study participant had a medical
history of treatment including hospitalization experienced before the study due to breast cancer and
a mastectomy (either partial or total)."

1. Introduction
Mobile phones have become a ubiquitous technology and their use is widespread internationally. However, there appear to be differences in terms of technology use across various geographical regions
according to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). Recently, ITU Facts and Figures
2017 [ 1] demonstrated that mobile phone use has experienced the largest growth compared with other
technologies over the last two decades. More speciﬁcally, worldwide mobile phone subscriptions per
100 inhabitants were 15.5 in 2001, 76.6 in 2010, and 103.5 in 2017. At the same time, subscriptions
for landline telephones were 16.6 in 2001, 17.8 in 2010, and 13 in 2017. According to a study by
ProQuest [ 2], the number of scientiﬁc papers and reports published on this topic has grown markedly. The study examined 26 scientiﬁc databases simultaneously (e.g., PsycINFO) using the search terms
“mobile phone” or “cell* phone” and “smartphone”."

with other chronic diseases, such as inﬂammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, epilepsy,
diabetes, or cardiovascular disease [ 16,35–41]. The signiﬁcant decrease in HRQoL in this population is
primarily inﬂuenced by: disease onset in the most productive years of an individual’s life, which affects
personal development and future plans negatively and jeopardizes their autonomy, independence,
and dignity; lack of effective treatment; the unpredictable course of the disease (it is difﬁcult to
determine when recurrences will happen and how serious the resulting disability will be); and the
wide range of symptoms [ 16,37,42,43]. All this makes it difﬁcult for patients to maintain control
over their symptoms and their life. There is the additional burden of neuropsychiatric complications,
including cognitive disorders and mood disorders such as depression, which may be manifestations of
the disease itself (i.e., demyelinization and inﬂammation) or may be related to the process of struggling
with the symptoms of the disease and its unpredictability. In the Polish population, an important
problem is also the limited availability and high cost of treatments which modify the course of the
disease. Poland is the only country in the European Union that has not introduced a national MS
treatment program, so patients have little access to free treatment and rehabilitation [ 44]. However,
studies show that the quality of life of Polish MS patients does not differ signiﬁcantly from the quality
of life of those in other countries, such as the United States or Italy [45]. 2. Materials and Methods

The average time of diagnosing a fetus defect was week 15.6 of pregnancy, whereas the average
time of termination was week 18.0 of pregnancy. The time of the procedure is mainly due to the need
to wait for traditional genetic tests where the average waiting time is at least two weeks. In our study group, TOP was performed in only four isolated cases of heart defects. Genetic
defects constituted half (50.7%) of the diagnosed problems, followed by malformation syndromes
(13.3%), and defects of the central nervous system (15.3%). Out of the genetic defects, trisomies were
the most common (including Trisomy 21 (42%), Trisomy 18 (23%) and Trisomy 13 (8%)), followed by
triploidies (15%). Minor isolated structural pathologies without the conﬁrmation of a genetic defect,
e.g., club hands, radial agenesis, agenesis of corpus callosum, were not indications for the TOP . 3.1. Community Support in Pregnancy Termination
A vast majority of the respondents said that the opinion of people in their surroundings did not
matter to them. Only 5% of women said that the opinion of other people in their surroundings was
important to them, which is reﬂected in the high median and dominant (Table 1). Table 1. Importance of the opinion of people in close surroundings on pregnancy termination,

Around 120–150 terminations per year are performed in the I Department of Obstetrics and
Gynecology, Center of Postgraduate Medical Education, Warsaw, Poland. Almost all of these procedures
in Poland are performed due to irreversible fetal defects that lead to severe fetal damage or death of
the child after birth [1]. Compared to other European countries, Polish law is one of the most restrictive for abortion. Similar to other ex-Soviet Union states, legal abortion has been widely available since 1956. However,

that is the case, perhaps a re-evaluation of OCPD /APD and a more detailed approach to its diagnosis
is needed. 4. OCPD /APD, Work Addiction, Burn-Out, and the Global Burden of Disease
Depression is among the most common causes of working disability in industrialized countries. A Finnish study showed that 50% of men and 28% of women with ﬁrst-episode depression
among employed individuals recruited from occupational health care units were diagnosed with
OCPD /APD [ 34]. This is consistent with the e ect sizes reported for the relationship between
OCPD /APD and burn-out [ 17]. The current estimated cost of depression related to stress at work in the
European Union is ¿617 billion annually [ 35], which is more than the gross domestic product (GDP)
of most European countries [ 36]. Neuropsychiatric disorders and non-communicable diseases such
as cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes are among the leading causes of the global burden of
disease [ 37]. Their total costs related to work stress are more than alarming, with the second most-costly
category being CVD [35]. When taking into account the available data concerning the potential physiological mechanisms
associating burn-out with CVD [ 38], well-evidenced association between depression and CVD [ 39]
and especially with prognosis after acute coronary syndrome [ 40], overlapping of burn-out and
depression [ 41], and the relationship between OCPD /APD and depression [ 11], it is surprising that
there is so little research examining OCPD /APD, burn-out, and depression as independent risk factors
for CVD. Moreover, it was recently argued that a high workload and its determinants, including
potential genetic vulnerabilities, could be a substantial unaccounted confounding factor in studies
related to the association between CVD and stimulant consumption, such as ca eine, the most widely
used legal stimulant worldwide [42].Int. J. Environ."

include or speciﬁcally recognize the self-imposed ‘unrelenting workload’ with which compulsive
workers burden themselves. This is partially the reason why there are no adequate estimates of the
extent to which long working hours are determined by speciﬁc life circumstances and basic needs, and
to what extent they are driven by a compulsion to work. The recognized risk factors, interventions, and good practices that protect and promote mental
health in the workplace suggested by the WHO [ 5] could theoretically be exhaustive, meaning that
a perfect implementation would completely reduce risks. However, this would only be true if two
assumptions are made: (i) That every working professional is a member of an organization, and that
(ii) there are only risk factors related to the work structure and work environment which have to be
managed. However, it can be argued that these are unrealistic assumptions. For example, according
to Eurostat [ 49], there were more than 32 million self-employed individuals in the European Union
accounting for 14% of total employment, with almost one in every three individuals in Greece being
self-employed in 2018 (30%), and around one in ﬁve in Italy (22%), Poland (18%), and Romania (17%). This means that such individuals manage their own work behaviors. Therefore, any policy solution

extent a mediating level between macro-level demands and micro-level vulnerabilities and compulsive
overworking, and without changes on the macro-level (e.g., governmental policies) interventions on
the lower levels will be to a signiﬁcant extent limited in e ectiveness. A special case is where there is
no organizational level in-between. For example, if the government allows medical doctors to work an
unlimited number of hours under self-employment, it can be expected that individuals with particular
vulnerabilities may devote an inordinate amount of e ort to work despite evident serious negative
consequences for their and /or their families psychosocial functioning (moderating e ect of macro-level
policies in Figure 1). In fact, this has been recently recognized by the Doctors’ Trade Union of Poland
as one of the factors involved in physicians’ death cases due to long working hours [74]. It has been demonstrated that the prevalence of a disease or disorder in a population has
a relationship with the average level of behaviors related to that disease /disorder within the

overworking individuals reﬂects population work-related behaviors. In recent decades across Asia,
numerous countries have experienced rapid economic growth, and at the same time, there has been an
increase in overwork-related deaths and suicides, together with other indicators of the decline in health
and wellbeing due to work overload [ 76]. This does not indicate that economic growth causes poorer

trust in medicine, doctors or scientiﬁc knowledge, and negatively correlated with trust in horoscopes. The present ﬁndings also point to the need to maintain vaccination obligations. While only 2.3%
of parents declared that they have avoided mandatory childhood vaccination at least once, 8.5% of
parents would stop vaccinating their children if the vaccination obligation was abolished. The state of vaccine conﬁdence di ers between the countries [ 19,20]. Results of the Vaccine
Conﬁdence Project (VCP)—one of the largest cross-sectional surveys on vaccine conﬁdence (65,819
individuals across 67 countries; 2015) showed that the European region had lower conﬁdence in the
safety of vaccines than other world regions [ 20]. In 2015, among the European Union (EU) countries,
the lowest levels of safety-based conﬁdence issues were observed in France, Greece, Slovenia, and
Italy [ 19]. In 2018, a similar study was carried out among 28,782 participants from 28 EU countries. The majority of the EU citizens agreed that vaccines are important (90.0%), safe (82.8%) and e ective
(87.8%) [ 19]. However, attitudes towards vaccination among EU citizens changed between 2015 and
2018 [ 19]. In 2015–2018, the state of vaccine conﬁdence increased in France, Greece, Slovenia and Italy,
but decreased in Poland, the Czech Republic, Finland and Sweden [ 19]. Over 4 years in Poland, the
percentage of respondents agreeing that vaccines are important for children has decreased by 9.2%;
vaccines are safe by 7.3%; vaccines are e ective by 7.7% [ 19]."
10-3390_ijerph17124565.pdf,Union,"In addition to traditional TV interviews and
expert debates, social media was a leading communication channel in the ﬁeld of vaccine education. Moreover, in 2018, when the public bill was proceeded by the Polish Parliament, Chief Sanitary
Inspector and Minister of National Education prepared an information brochure about vaccination,
which was sent to all parents of school children (4.6 million students from nearly 24,000 schools from
all over Poland) via an electronic journal (monitoring system of the child’s progress in learning) [ 30]. The increased conﬁdence in vaccines and their safety in Poland in recent years may result from the
nationwide debate about vaccines in mass media as well as communicational activities (focused on
health promotion) carried out by the public health authorities using social media. Public health
authorities should use novel technologies and social media to address new public health challenges. The current outbreak of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and the media hype surrounding this can
provide a good basis for discussions on infectious diseases and the need for preventive vaccinations. There are di erent immunization systems within the European Union. In most Central and Eastern
European countries including Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary vaccinations
are mandatory [ 10]. There are a growing number of EU countries that have expanded theirmandatory
vaccination programmes [ 31,32]. In 2017, Italy extended the number of compulsory vaccines from four
to ten, which results in increase vaccine coverage for all vaccines [ 31]. In 2018, France extended its
mandatory vaccination programme from three to eleven diseases [ 32]. This indicates that in Europe
there is a tendency to extend the mandatory immunization system rather than to abolish the obligation."

Abstract: Increasing evidence suggests adults living in greener areas tend to have more favourable
sleep-related outcomes, but children and adolescents are under-researched. We hypothesised that
children and adolescents living in greener areas would have better quality and more su cient levels
of sleep on average, especially within the context of high tra c noise exposure. These hypotheses
were tested using multilevel logistic regressions ﬁtted on samples from the nationally representative
Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (10–11 years old, n=3469, and 14–15 years old, n=2814 )
and the GINIplus and LISA cohorts (10 years old, n=1461, and 15 years old, n=4172) from the Munich,
Wesel, and Leipzig areas of Germany. Questionnaire-based binary indicators of sleep su ciency and
sleep quality in each cohort were assessed with respect to objectively measured green space exposures
adjusting for age, sex, and maternal education. Models were augmented with proxy measures of
trac noise and two-way interaction terms to test for e ect modiﬁcation. Cross-tabulations illustrated

1. Introduction
Air pollution is a major risk factor for disease worldwide and is estimated to cause almost 500,000
premature annual deaths across Europe [ 1]. Studies have shown that long-term exposure to high levels
of air pollution a ects multiple organs in the human body, causing cardiovascular and respiratory
diseases [ 2]. Regarding the development of asthma, some studies have found childhood exposure to
air pollution to be a risk factor [ 3], while other studies did not reveal those e ects [ 4]. Less is known
regarding the intergenerational e ects of exposure to lower levels of air pollution, e.g., levels below
recommended limits from the European Union (EU) and the World Health Organisation (WHO) [ 5,6],
on ospring asthma and hay fever. Exposure to greenspace has, on the other hand, been associated with beneﬁcial health e ects
such as reduced risk of mortality, diabetes, and high blood pressure [ 7]. However, e ects of greenness
on asthma and allergies are less clear [ 8–11]. Some studies have indicated decreased respiratory
morbidity in adulthood due to living near green areas [ 7,12–14] while the e ects of residential greenness
on childhood allergic rhinitis and aeroallergen sensitization have depended on the region [ 15–18]. Access to green areas may decrease stress through rest, increase opportunities for physical activity and
increase social interaction [ 19]. Furthermore, vegetation may remove pollutants such as ozone (O 3),
particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) from the air and may reduce exposure to harmful
noise [ 9,20]."

during the competition in a negative way, which indicates a possible direction for future research
(e.g., performing discriminatory or regression analysis) to ﬁnd the individual di erences or situational
determinants between athletes belonging to positive and negative groups. This could help to determine
the likely causes of less favorable, negative evaluations, which, in turn, would allow suggesting the
methods that work best to sports psychologists or coaches. The examined competitors preferred task-oriented coping strategies, as well as rarely applied
techniques, which form the basis of the mental training carried out by sport psychologists. Considering the most often applied strategies connected with concentrating on the goal and victory and
with planning and concentrating on activity, one could enquire what incentive contemporary athletes
follow. Concentrating on winning as a form of coping with stress may be a reﬂection of such a tendency
in sports where athletes seek external rewards, whether material (medals, cups, or ﬁnancial gratiﬁcation)
or immaterial (e.g., social prestige). Nevertheless, it should be emphasized that inappropriate forms of
external motivation may decrease or eliminate an athlete’s internal motivation [ 28] or increase one’s
cognitive anxiety [ 29]; thus, the way coaches or club managers o er praise or motivate their athletes is
very important. Furthermore, the reason that mental techniques are rarely used as coping strategies is
uncertain. It could be the lack of athletes’ willingness, the necessities involved in their application,
the athletes’ inability to use them, or simply their lack of knowledge about them. Additional interviews
with the participants indicated the two latter options were most likely. This may be due to the
still insu cient availability of sports psychologists or Poland’s unreadiness to use their services. Prior investigations suggested that mental training is an e ective way of improving people’s quality ofInt."

be studied in relation to these frameworks with wider utilization of qualitative research
methods in order to focus on the perspective of service users. We will be using some of the standard nomenclature for stylistic reasons and in order
to avoid more confusion, but it has to be noted that, for example, speaking of “symptoms,”
while the existence or presence of any underlying disorder is doubtful, may be misleading,
or that words like “intervention” convey a speciﬁc kind of relation (especially in terms of
power), which in fact may be harmful to “patients.” Similar problems arise with regards
to words such as “disease,” “illness” or “disorder” [ 15,16] and many others. The role of
language will also be very shortly addressed in appropriate sections later in the text. 2. The State of Affairs
2.1. Clinical Practice
There is a substantial diversity of settings in terms of mental health care across
countries and within countries, even within Global North, high income or European Union
countries. The Lancet Commission on Global Mental Health and Sustainable Development
acknowledges this while still providing recommendations to be implemented globally [ 17]. A systematic comparison of different systems across the world with all their nuances and
subtle differences would itself require a monumental work; however, it seems that it would
not be an overstatement to claim that, globally, the biomedical model of mental health is
dominating, even if there seem to be emerging trends for the inclusion of a more nuanced
perspective and a bigger emphasis on psychosocial interventions. The interventions are still
often based on a predominantly biomedical perspective and could be seen as an extension
of the biomedical model, where the “psychosocial” has been, in fact, colonized by the
“biomedical” [18]. Several examples from different countries may help in substantiating this claim. Even
though it may seem to be a controversial and contested statement, depression could be
considered to be a disorder that can be treated both pharmacologically or psychotherapeu-
tically with similar effectiveness, regardless of severity or symptom proﬁle, as indicated
by a recent meta-analysis [ 19]."
10-3390_ijerph18126625.pdf,Union,"The RAND Corporation report [ 36]
is probably the only one examining the global funding landscape for the whole of the
mental health ﬁeld. It also employed a bottom-up approach (analyzing research output and
funding acknowledgments) instead of a top-down analysis (looking at funding agencies),
which allowed for identifying funders omitted in many other studies. According to the report [ 36], Global North countries dominate the global research
landscape. Mental health research funders are located primarily in North America, North-
ern and Western Europe and China, with the United States as both the largest producer of
research and the biggest source of funding. The top 4 most often acknowledged funders
stem from the USA (US National Institutes of Health, NIMH, National Institute on Drug
Abuse, National Institute on Aging). Top 30 funders represent the following countries:
USA, Canada, Australia, European Union (as a distinct entity from the particular countries
of the EU), China, UK, Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Brazil, Japan, Sweden, and together
they are responsible for the funding of 96% of published research, with the USA alone
having a 56% share. This may reﬂect the role of the United States agencies, and indirectly
that of APA and American Psychological Association, in shaping the global mental health
discourse and practice. It is difﬁcult to assess what kind of research precisely gets funded and published. The
RAND report distinguishes four levels of research while providing journal names that
are supposed to reﬂect the type of research published; these are: 1. clinical observation
(e.g., Schizophrenia Bulletin ), 2. clinical mix (e.g., Journal of Psychiatric Research ), 3. clinical in-
vestigation (e.g., Neuropsychopharmacology) and 4. basic biomedical (e.g., Neuroscience). Estimating what percentage, if any, represents studies dealing with psychosocial inter-
ventions and factors within these categories would require a dedicated research project;
however, even the category names, journals provided as examples and their research scope
may suggest that it is a rather modest share. For example, even though Schizophrenia
Bulletin editorial policy states “[w]e view the ﬁeld as broad and deep, and will publish
new knowledge ranging from the molecular basis to social and cultural factors.” This is
immediately followed by: “[w]e will give new emphasis to translational reports which
simultaneously highlight basic neurobiological mechanisms and clinical manifestations,”
and there is no mention of psychology or psychotherapy [ 37]."

1. Introduction
Poland, with at least three-quarters of adults (87%) identifying themselves as Catholics
(Pew Research Center; PRC Pew Research Center), is one of the European countries where Catholics
are still the largest religious group. However, di erent studies (Büssing et al. 2014) report that the
situation in Poland has lately begun to change, and religion is gradually becoming a private matter
for some believers, beyond institutionalized participation. In fact, the religious proﬁle of Poland,
presented by a recent PRC (Pew Research Center) report and based on an overall combined index,
shows that 23% of Polish young adults under 40 are signiﬁcantly less likely to consider religion as very
important in their lives, compared with 40% of older ones. Similar patterns are found in 45 other states
out of 106 countries surveyed by PRC (Pew Research Center). Although the reasons for the age gap in
religious commitment are complex and mostly related to di erent historical and socio-cultural factors,
it is plausible to assume that such disparity may reﬂect struggles faced by the young generation on
dierent levels of religious and spiritual life (Kwako Golo et al."

concluded that the Catholic Church does not meet the people’s needs, and especially that it does not
provide answers to questions on moral and family problems (Guzik et al. 2015). This can foster a decline
in the level of religiousness of young people, especially adolescents, who rebel against church teaching,
and finally they may decide to walk away from religion. Psychologists coined the term deconversion to describe “the depth and intensity of biographical
change that can be associated with disbelief and /or disa liation” (Paloutzian et al. 2013, p. 408). They refer to Barbour’s (Barbour 1994) deﬁnition of deconversion, which describes “the loss or
deprivation of religious faith” and includes four factors: (1) intellectual doubt in regard to the truth of a
system of beliefs, (2) rejection of the way of life of a religious group, (3) emotional su ering (e.g., grief,
guilt, loneliness, despair), and (4) disa liation from the community. Streib and Keller (2004) identiﬁed
ﬁve dimensions of deconversion: (1) loss of speciﬁc religious experiences, such as the loss of meaning
and purpose in life; the loss of the experience of God, of trust, or of fear; (2) intellectual doubt, denial, or
disagreement with speciﬁc beliefs; (3) moral criticism, which includes a rejection of speciﬁc prescriptions
and/or the application of a new level of moral judgement; (4) emotional su ering, which can consist

religious practices. From these ﬁve dimensions, ﬁnally, termination of membership eventually follows. Considering these ﬁve characteristics, deconversion cannot be understood as merely disa liation
from the religious group but rather as an intense process that includes both individual and social
aspects—experiential, emotional, intellectual, social, and moral (Paloutzian et al. 2013). Although extensive literature exists on religiousness in adolescents (e.g., Petts 2009; Desmond et al."

processes (Halama et al. 2013; Kirkpatrick and Shaver 1990; Longo and Kim-Spoon 2014)."
10-3390_rel12040240.pdf,religious* group,"Previous studies demonstrated that religious people did not necessarily adhereReligions 2021 ,12, 240 3 of 22
to COVID-19 mitigation guidelines. During the introduction of the COVID-19 mitigation
policy in the United States, religiosity in a community led to decreased adherence to shelter-
in-place directives (DeFranza et al. 2020). High individual religiosity, therefore, could
prompt one to act against rules (e.g., sanitary rules) that interfere with or violate religious
values. Extrinsic religious orientation and the authority of the clergy could have also been
challenged due to the alteration in religious rituals during the pandemic. Previous studies
demonstrating the psychological sense of community and identiﬁcation with one’s religious
group were correlated with personal well-being (Obst and Tham 2009). However, concerns
about negative experiences with religious people or institutions and interpersonal conﬂicts
related to religious issues may imply a sense of religious and spiritual struggle (Exline
et al. 2014). Religious individuals may experience stress when they face hypocrisy from
believers and the clergy (Krause et al. 2000). Disagreements among group members
about interpersonal issues, such as differences in norms and values, could also result in
intragroup relationship conﬂicts (Jehn 1997)."
10-3390_rel12040240.pdf,religious* group,"The bias was stronger when the group identiﬁcation was more
pronounced (Demoulin et al. 2009; Mirosławska and Kofta 2007). The various forms of
intragroup bias included e.g., infrahumanization (subtle dehumanization of out-groups by
treating them as less human; Leyens 2009) and the intergroup empathy bias (the tendency
not only to empathize less with out-group relative to in-group members, but also to feel
pleasure in response to their pain and pain in response to their pleasure; Cikara et al. 2014). The consequences of such intergroup biases are severe (e.g., diminished prosociality,
increased antisociality, moral outrage toward out-groups; cf. Haslam and Loughnan 2014).Religions 2021 ,12, 240 4 of 22
Previous studies demonstrated that intergroup bias (favoritism and derogation) may
indeed exist within the same religious group. Swan et al. (2014) demonstrated that the
degree of belief and indicators of dogmatic thinking moderated the effect of favorable
perception of a member of the religious in-group. That study showed that more positive
evaluations of a target religious person depended on the assumption of the target person’s
strong but ﬂexible belief. The attitude toward religious in-groups who did not share the same beliefs about the
proper form of receiving Holy Communion in the pandemic can be explained from the
point of view of costly signaling theory (Sosis 2005). Religion often involves costly signals
such as elaborate rituals, and such behaviors are understood to communicate commitment
to one’s in-group (Sosis and Alcorta 2003)."

the mouth might be understood as a costly signal of commitment to the religious group,
while changing the form of reception of Holy Communion during the pandemic might be

ritualistic activity is a common practice (Hüsken 2007). Although rituals are perceived as rather static and unchanging, most of them do in fact
undergo changes (e.g., in the course of time, as a result of their transfer to another cultural
context, or because they are ‘updated’ to meet the requirements of changed circumstances;
Hüsken 2007). There are various types of deviation from an original or earlier version of a
ritual (Grimes 1990) and some of these deviations can be judged negatively (e.g., as ritual
failures). Ritual failures refer to cases in which a ritual is performed imperfectly, giving
rise to its challenging and negotiation in relation to the ritual community’s developing
identity (Hüsken and Neubert 2012). The alteration of rituals due to the preventive
measures imposed during the pandemic can trigger a process of ritual change or negotiation. While some members of the religious group can judge the alteration of receiving Holy
Communion as justiﬁed by the circumstances and as not altering the meaning of the ritual,
another part of the religious community may perceive this alteration as ritual violation
or misexecution (Grimes 1990). This division can cause intergroup negativity within the

1.3. The Present Study
The goals of the ﬁrst study were to investigate how the individual’s beliefs about the
proper form of reception of Holy Communion affected (a) affective reactions toward the
religious group as a whole (Roman Catholics); (b) the legitimacy of the Church authority
in Poland; and (c) perceptions of the members of the religious group who did not share
the individual’s beliefs about the proper form of reception of Holy Communion during
the COVID-19 pandemic. The choice to obey sanitary suggestions connected with receiv-
ing Holy Communion on the hand may have resulted from the fear of infection (Clark
et al. 2020) and may have been also related to more anger, less trust, and commitment
toward those followers who did not obey the instructions. Thus, we hypothesized that
the participants who held the beliefs that Holy Communion should be received on the
hand would be the most affectively ambivalent (i.e., they would report the highest level of
negative emotions, such as fear and anger, and the lowest level of positive emotions, e.g.,
trust) toward their religious group compared to the individuals who recognized reception
in the mouth or both forms as proper."

“hand only” and “mouth only” groups, intragroup conﬂict would arise, and intergroup
bias would occur. We investigated in-group favoritism or out-group derogation in the
ascription of religiosity (measured as intrinsic and extrinsic orientation to religion). We
predicted that members of the in-groups would be perceived as more religious (they would
obtain a more favorable assessment on both intrinsic and extrinsic orientation to religion)
compared to the members of the out-groups."
10-3390_rel12040240.pdf,religious* group,"The participants rated how frequently
they felt such emotions toward their Church members on a Likert-type scale ranging
from 0 ( Never ) to 4 ( Very often ). The principal factor analysis yielded a clear two-
factor solution (explained variance = 61.455%), with the factors of positive emotions
(loadings > 0.702) and negative emotions (loadings > 0.657). The reliability of posi-
tive emotions toward the religious community was = 0.838, while the reliability of
negative emotions toward the religious community was = 0.747.  Perceived legitimacy of Church authority: It was measured with three items adopted
from Van der Toorn et al. (2015). The items were reworded and were as follows:
“I feel I should accept the decisions made by my Church authorities, even when I
think they are wrong”; “I think that it hurts my religious group when I disagree with
my Church authorities”; and “I feel that it is wrong to ignore the instructions of my
Church authorities even when I can get away with it”. The responses were made on a
5-point scale ranging from 0 ( Disagree strongly ) to 4 ( Agree strongly ). The reliability of
the measure was = 0.823.  In-group and out-group perceived religious orientation: The study participants were
asked to rate how statements regarding intrinsic and extrinsic orientation to religion
were characteristic of persons who received Holy Communion on the hand or in the
mouth. These sentences were adopted from the Age Universal I-E scale-12 (Maltby
1999) and reworded in order to assess the perception of a particular group. The
participants used a Likert-type scale ranging from 0 ( Very bad ) to 4 ( Very good ), with
the mid-point of 2 ( Hard to tell )."
10-3390_rel12040240.pdf,religious* group,"Again,
the obtained results are consistent with costly signaling (Sosis 2005). People who did not
engage in costly signaling were perceived less favorably (e.g., Hall et al. 2015). Thus, their
religious orientations were estimated as lower compared to those who maintained costly
signaling during the pandemic. Future studies should investigate potential intrapersonal
threats experienced by those conservative followers such as fear of disregard for holiness. The present study showed that individual religious orientation predicted positive
affect experienced toward the religious group members, the legitimacy of the Church
authority (mainly the intrinsic orientation), and ascription of religiosity to others (mainly
the extrinsic orientation). Individual religious orientation did not alter the intergroup
effects, which were connected to the social categorization processes related to the different
beliefs of followers about the proper form of reception of Holy Communion during the
pandemic. However, future studies should investigate personal predictors of beliefs aboutReligions 2021 ,12, 240 12 of 22
receiving Holy Communion during the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., fear of COVID-19;
Clark et al. 2020; or moral foundations; Graham and Haidt 2010) and analyze whether
these personal variables may moderate the intergroup processes. Previous studies showed
that both fear of COVID-19 and moral foundations predicted higher behavior change

its individual factors: Experience of God ( a=0.67), Relationship With God ( a=0.91),

of God’s silence should be analyzed and explored in research studies and approached in
therapeutic interventions as a multidimensional compound of experiences. The results of
our study suggest, after all, that God’s silence may also be seen by people as a predictor
of growth—a positive change in the process of religious and spiritual struggle. Against
this background, our research adds to the as yet small number of studies on spiritual
and religious struggles in the context of their positive effect on the perceived processes of
development and growth (cf. Zarzycka 2017). The present study has a few limitations that
should be noted. Although it involved various groups of Christians in Poland, where the
level of declared faith in society is above 98%, the vast majority of our respondents were
Catholics, which reﬂects the fact that they are the largest religious group in this country. As
far as the results are concerned, although the present study broadens the knowledge about
the experience of God’s silence as one of the signs of religious and spiritual struggle, all
data analyzed in it are cross-sectional, which makes it impossible to draw cause-and-effect
conclusions. Most of the information about the experience of God’s silence is self-report
data, and the relationship or bond with God, and spiritual growth can be investigated by
means of methods and instruments other that those relating it to the frequency of spiritual
experiences measured using one scale. Further research into the experience of God’s silence,
particularly research looking for answers to the question of how this kind of experience
can predict spiritual and emotional growth, should focus more broadly on the intensity of
religious and spiritual struggles, the context of religious commitment, and the ability to
cope with difﬁcult situations, taking into account dispositional factors. Author Contributions: Conceptualization, J.P . and J.W. ; Methodology, J.P . and J.W."

the increase in perceived normativity of anti-Muslim
hate  speech  can  act  as  one  of  the  mechanisms
through which the use of social media leads to in -
creased Islamoprejudice. Importantly, we did not find
any evidence for such a mechanism in the case of the
secular critique of Islam. The results of this study show that digital media
consumption (as opposed to traditional media con -
sumption)  is  related  to  higher  Islamoprejudice  and
that this relationship is mostly driven by greater per -
ceived normativity of hate speech among those im -
mersed in digital media. Therefore, it is plausible that– as hypothesized – digital media create an environ -
ment  in  which  hate  speech  becomes  a  descriptive
norm  (Prentice  2007). The  normalization  of  hate
speech in digital media also affects the way in which
minority groups are perceived. For example, the prob -
lem of Islamist radicalization is viewed in a discrimi -
natory  way  that  blames  the  whole  religious  group
rather  than  the  extremists  within  that  community. Digital media users and those who mostly use tradi -
tional media do not differ in the extent of their secular
critique of Muslim radicalization. This supports the
view that digital media does not make people more
informed about Islamist radicalization or politics in
general. The only clear effect that we observed is that
digital media consumption is associated with greater
acceptance of hate speech, and that this normaliza -
tion process is associated with greater Islamopreju -
dice among those whose knowledge about politics is
mostly derived from social media, citizen journalism
sites and other online media. 8.1 Theoretical Advancement
In the present study we found that people immersed
in digital media – due to the weak legal regulation of
such media – develop a different sense of norms in
which hate speech is no longer a delinquent behavior. Obscenity and insults are observed to be normative in
race talk online, especially in situations where influ -
ential figures are seen to support racism online (Au -
gust and Liu 2015)."

ity of depressiveness, which has been demonstrated in particular with respect to interleukin 5 [21]. Our own 
research  has shown that the level of mRNA for interleu-  
kin 15 in patients with bronchial asthma correlates with 
the temperamental personality traits [22], and that there 
is a relationship between asthma patients’ personality 
and a polymorphism of the gene coding for the glucocor -
ticosteroid receptor [9]. Depressiveness is often associat -
ed with anxiety, which, especially in the form of attacks, 
can induce bronchospasm in the course of asthma [23]. Bronchial contraction is the result of both hyperventila -
tion and exposure to cold air as well as regulation with mediators of the autonomic system innervating the bronchi [23, 24]. A shortcoming of our research work is 
the lack of measurement of anxiety as a state, although 
it is well known to correlate with the severity of depres-
siveness as a component of the neuroticism superfactor 
according to Eysenck’s model of personality or the Big 
Five model [7, 8]. We have demonstrated the association 
between anxiety and depressiveness in patients with 
asthma in many of our other publications [1, 3]. It has 
been suggested that increased central respiratory drive 
correlating with neuroticism and medication arouses the 
subjective feeling of breathlessness and induces bron-
chospasm, which is automatically associated with poor 
control of asthma [25]. Depressive subjects with type D 
personality pay less attention to taking prescribed medi-
cations regularly."

10-5114_aoms-2017-68943.pdf,Associat,"The results of different studies differ in terms of particular 
categories of psychopathological symptoms, but they usually point to their more frequent occur -
rence among individuals who are soon to develop 
dementia [22]. Mood disorders preceding the de-
terioration of cognitive functions seem the most 
typical [23]. The more frequent occurrence and 
severity of mood disorders in the MCI-D group, on both the NPI and the GDS scales, was also con-
firmed in this study (Tables II and III). The concept of the chronic character of demen-
tia conditions assumes the presence of a  long-term pre-clinical phase in which the biological 
processes leading to brain lesions have already 
begun [24, 25]. Clinical symptoms which occur 
in the period preceding the development of ful-ly symptomatic dementia are usually associated with a gradual decline in cognitive functions. Im-
pairment of immediate memory and the associat-
ed “distraction” often appear in the early stages of 
the disease and in periods preceding the disease 
[26]. Particular attention is given to the diagnos-tic importance of impairments in delayed recall 
[27]. The above symptoms are also considered to 
be typical of MCI, which may give the impression that differentiation between the initial stages of 
Alzheimer’s disease and MCI is practically impos-
sible. A concern may even arise about whether it is justified at all to diagnose MCI, understood as 
a  separate diagnostic category, in an individual 
exhibiting even a  small progression of cognitive 
impairments. When selecting for inclusion in this study, more 
rigorous criteria diagnostic criteria for MCI were adopted, based on modern guidelines [9]. Obser -
vation of the group selected this way suggests 
that a gradual decline of cognitive functions is ob-
served in most people with MCI, but the nature of 
this decline varies between individuals."

cially in individuals of young population between 
the ages of 13 and 18 years [11]. Research on the long-term physical health con-
sequences of early-onset major depression has demonstrated that major depression is associat-ed with considerable chronic physical health [12]. Over half of the individuals who recover from the first episode of depression will suffer at least one additional episode later in life, whereas approx-imately 80% of those with a  history of two epi-sodes will experience another recurrence [13]. As meta-analysis reports suggest, the propor -
tion of the adult population experiencing any form of mood disorder represented by the avail-able data in Eastern Europe is estimated at 0.47%, which is extremely low when compared with the corresponding proportion of 17–40% in Western European countries. These data refer to gener -
al mood disorders, particularly anxiety [6, 14]. However, this disproportion may be influenced by differences in reporting rates between coun-tries representing various economic status. The data for the Polish population are limited because no national comorbidity surveys, which are rou-tinely performed in other countries, have been performed in Poland."
10-5114_aoms-2020-94530.pdf,Union,"Our analysis was based on the 
clinical data gathered by, and obtained from, day-care wards and psychiatric hospitals in the whole country. The research demonstrated a continual-
ly increasing number of children and adolescents 
treated for psychiatric disorders. This finding indi-cates an apparent worsening of the mental health 
status in this age group in Poland, because the 
actual prevalence of mental problems among chil-dren and adolescents in Poland is probably higher 
than what we observed. These findings raise con-
cern because major depression is not a condition 
that can be completely cured. According to some 
studies, the risk of depressive episode recurrence in children and adolescents can be as high as 30–
70% [20]. The increase in the rate of mental health issues 
recorded in Polish children and adolescents could be due to many factors within socio-economic 
changes after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. This was a  great opportunity for rapid changes 
throughout the privatisation process in Poland 
but also introduced the risk of a negative impact 
on family life, especially for the young population. Rapid economic transformations could induce changes to the style of work, which also could af-
fect the style of life and parents-children relations. Parents had less time to focus on their children 
and adolescents, which is one of the most import-
ant factors for their mental health. The issue of the high prevalence rate of depres-
sion presented in our study cannot be explained 
with this basic data analysis, and more research 
is needed to explain this phenomenon. Evidently, 
because depression is a condition with complex 
aetiopathogenesis, many factors can contribute 
to this mental health problem being so common  
[18, 20]."
10-5114_cipp-2017-68341.pdf,Associat,"Some authors equate these two concepts 
(Westphal &  Bonanno, 2007), while others assume 
that the growth after trauma is a  form of resilien-
cy (Johnson et al. 2007), and others that post-trau-matic growth is more significant than resiliency and 
plays an overriding role (Lepore & Revenson, 2006). Tedeschi and Calhoun (1996) clearly differentiate 
these two concepts, stressing that the growth after 
trauma is due to the transformation and can appear suddenly and unexpectedly. In contrast, resiliency, 
a property of personality, is relatively constant and 
develops as a result of the accumulation of multiple 
experiences by the individual. Tedeschi and Calhoun 
emphasize that resilient people may not experience growth because a traumatic event may not represent 
a sufficiently strong challenge for them. As demon-Magdalena Kobylarczyk, Nina Ogińska-Bulik99

role in preventing the negative effects of the expe-
rienced trauma than fostering the growth of posi-
tive post-traumatic changes, as although the study 
findings indicated that resiliency was a predictor of post-traumatic stress symptoms, it was not associat-ed with growth following traumatic events (Ogińs-ka-Bulik, 2015b). A  revised model of posttraumatic growth presented by Tedeschi and Calhoun (1996, 2004) highlights the importance to properties of pre-trauma personality, cognitive activity and applied coping strategies in the process of positive posttrau-matic changes. limi TaTions
This research does have certain limitations. The neg-ative effects of experienced events, for example in the form of post-traumatic stress symptoms, were not an-alysed. In addition, the examined adolescents experi-enced a range of varied negative life events, which could have affected the assessment of the perceived positive changes to varying degrees. These changes were evaluated using a self-reporting questionnaire, which could influence the results."

The study included 157 participants (women n = 35, men 
n = 122; individual sports n = 88 and team sports n = 69). Measures used in the study were the Formal Characteris-tics of Behaviour – Temperament Inventory (FCB-TI) and the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ). results 
Among women and men chronotype was positively corre-lated with Briskness (BR) and Endurance (EN). In women chronotype was negatively related to Emotional Reactiv-ity (ER). Sensory Sensitivity (SS) was positively associat-ed with chronotype in men. In the individual sport group chronotype was associated with four temperamental traits: BR, EN, ER (negatively) and SS. Activity (AC) signifi-cantly correlated with chronotype in the team sport group. Two out of three indicators of temperament structure – potential for stimulation processing (MPS) and structure harmony parameter (Zh1) – were related to chronotype in both genders. conclusions
The results obtained in the present research indicate that temperament is significantly related to chronotype. Evening chronotype men and women might be overstimu-lated and morning types might be understimulated."
10-5114_cipp-2017-68892.pdf,Associat,"Therefore, Eagleton, McKelvie, and de Man (2007), comparing undergraduate team and individual sport partici‑
pants and nonparticipants, showed that team ath‑letes gained higher scores in Extraversion than both 
individual sport participants and nonparticipants. Similar results were observed by the author of the questionnaire (Eysenck, Nias, &  Cox, 1982). This is 
consistent with our results for the AC trait. However, 
it must be highlighted that the effect size of differ‑
ences between groups in our study was small. We 
could treat the obtained results as a trend rather than a certainty. This argument and the lack of differences 
between results in other temperament traits is prob‑
ably connected with the fact that every sport disci‑
pline has its own specific character, and is associat‑
ed with various training and competing conditions. Other traits could be desirable for good performance. For example, despite the fact that among athletes 
those with low reactivity dominate, high reactivity may help to achieve high performance in sports re‑
quiring precise movements and sensitivity to musical 
rhythm (Gracz & Sankowski, 2007). Combining dif‑
ferent disciplines in the categories – individual/team 
– the differences become blurred. This study also reveals a distinction (rather weak) 
in the result of chronotype depending on the type of sport. Those of the participants who practise in‑
dividual disciplines obtained higher results in the 
KRAD questionnaire, which means they can be char‑acterized more as ‘larks’ than ‘owls’."
10-5114_cipp-2018-72050.pdf,Associat,"Scant studies on the influence of self-enhance-
ment on materialistic tendencies show that in a  self-enhancement situation people may be more materialistic and have a greater desire for prestige goods (Mandel, Petrova, & Cialdini, 2001; Zawadz-ka & Niesiobędzka 2010; Zawadzka, Strużyńska-Ku-jałowicz, & Zawisza 2013). However, the question of how self-improvement affects materialistic tenden-
cies in a  self-enhancement situation has not been 
answered yet. Therefore, the present study looks into the role 
of self-improvement in the growth of materialistic tendencies. It examines the following issues: a) how self-improvement influences materialistic aspirations and attitudes towards symbolic goods in a self-threat situation and b) how self-improvement influences materialistic aspirations and attitudes towards sym-bolic goods in a self-enhancement situation.SELF-THREAT SITUATION, 
ACQUISITION, AND POSSESSION  
VS. SELF-IMPROVEMENT
Material goods have a symbolic nature because a cer-tain social meaning (e.g. status) is attached to them 
(Dittmar, 1992; Ledgerwood, Liviatan, &  Carnevale, 
2007). Money is also a  means of attaining a  higher status in the social system and is positively associat-ed with social circumstances (i.e. social acceptance) (Lea & Webley, 2006). Symbolic self-completion the-ory (Wicklund &  Gollwitzer, 1982) indicates that in a  self-threat situation individuals may use material symbols of a specific competence to compensate for its absence. Furthermore, in a  situation when the 
self-concept is incomplete people may use goods 
symbolising the desired self-concept. For example, 
Braun and Wicklund (1989) found that freshmen buy 
more items symbolising being a  student than those who are about to graduate. Other research showed that in a  self-threat situation material possessions may facilitate restoring the self through associations with the symbolic meaning of a specific product with the aspect of self-threat (Braun &  Wicklund, 1989; 
Wicklund & Gollwitzer, 1981)."

tion. Such results mean that high levels of these per-
sonality traits favour risky decisions in highly stim-
ulating circumstances, but may not affect risk-taking without additional incentives. On the other hand, a self-reported tendency towards risk was associat-ed with risk-taking in the Stock Market task and in the Spaceride task, but only in non-rewarded condi-
tion. Perhaps self-reported estimations of one’s own risk propensity are made with “cold” conditions in mind, thus reflecting more accurately the behaviour 
in non-incentivised conditions. Such a  suspicion is 
difficult to confirm without additional research. In the Stock Market, a high level of sensation seek-
ing favoured risky decisions only in non-rewarded condition, while impulsivity was not associated with risk-taking at all. The fact that high impulsivity is re-lated to risk-taking in “hot” but not “cold” tasks seems understandable given the differences between them. Decisions whether to take risks in the Spaceride are 
taken quickly and under momentary pressure, while  
the Stock Market requires deliberation and is less time-
bound."
10-5114_cipp-2018-75750.pdf,Union,"After inter-viewing 300 young people Arnett noticed that all of them reported the “feeling of being in-between”, 
not a child but not having adult responsibilities like 
marriage, parenthood, or a stable job yet. Therefore, he proposed a new period of life-span development that he called “emerging adulthood” (Arnett, 2004). Post-industrial societies do not define unambiguous expectations towards young people, therefore they 
may enjoy freedom of  choice in terms of  deciding 
on professional activity, entering into relationships and formalising them, and whether or not they want to become parents (Arnett, 2000; Baumann, 2008). However, the lack of a generally imposed “recipe for life” does not mean that the developmental tasks list-
ed by theoreticians are entirely outdated. It is rather 
the time point of their performance that has become 
flexible due to the prolonged time of coming to adult-
hood in comparison to previous generations, for ex-ample, due to the possibility of education, migration, and gaining professional qualifications (Ziółkowska, 2005). Furthermore, young people enjoy a  broader range of choices in respect of the roles they perform: 
for example, marriage alternatives such as consen-
sual union, or even giving up on an intimate rela-tionship and remaining single. Prior to taking up a full-time job, they can prolong their time spent on 
education or part-time work, or – referring mostly to 
people with high socio-economic family background status – remain financially dependent on their fami-lies (Gurba, 2002). Parentification is a  term introduced by Boszor-
menyi-Nagy (1973). The author defined his concept as a situation where the children or adolescents per-form adult roles even though they are not emotion-ally and developmentally ready to deal with those 
challenges (Boszormenyi-Nagy &  Spark, 1973). In 
this pattern of  family interactions, the child (also as an adult) provides care and support towards his/her parent instead of  receiving it from the parent (Jurkovic, 1997; Hooper, Marotta &  Lanthier, 2008; 
Hooper, DeCoster, White, & Voltz, 2011; Schier, 2010, 
2014). The phenomenon of  parentification appears when, due to a  family system disadvantageous for the child, the child must shoulder a  burden of  re-
sponsibilities, so that he/she is unable to entirely en-
gage into his/her own developmental tasks (Jurkovic, 1997; Hooper, 2007; Schier, 2010; Rostowska & Bor-chet, 2016; Borchet &  Lewandowska-Walter, 2017)."

current issues in personality psychologyBACKGROUND
Questionnaire-based study of personality relying on 
self-knowledge and self-report requires the subject’s 
introspection – insight into their own mental states, 
into their ideas of the world and their own self – as 
well as the capacity and willingness to communi-
cate honestly. Scholars differ in their evaluation of the quality of psychological assessment performed in 
this way. Although the usefulness of questionnaires 
in personality assessment is stressed – and in the 
case of psychopathic personality some even speak of 
their renaissance (Lilienfeld, 1998; Lilienfeld & Fowl-
er, 2006) – assessment specialists unanimously agree 
that questionnaires are prone to distortions (Goffin &  Boyd, 2009; Goffin &  Christiansen, 2003; McFar-
land & Ryan, 2006; Zickar & Robie, 1999). Some of 
the errors, such as those stemming from a permanent tendency to exhibit centrality or lateralization, or to 
give only positive or only negative answers – consid-
ered in terms of individual response style (Brzezińska 
& Brzeziński, 2011; Paulhus, 2002) – depend neither 
on the contents of the questionnaire’s items nor on the circumstances of the study
1. Others are associat-
ed with the interaction of item contents and the cir-
cumstances of the study and stem from intentional 
or unintentional aspirations of the subject, striving 
to achieve a goal. In the latter case (faking), it is possible to encoun-
ter an attitude of deliberately sabotaging the results by giving random or nonsensical answers and a prac-
tice of distorting “the truth about oneself” by choos-ing the answers that, in the subject’s opinion, attest to good social adjustment and are socially desirable. Errors of this kind are diverse (Paulhus, 1984, 2002). Strategies of deception in self-report can be defined 
as “faking good” and “faking bad” response sets. In 
the latter case, distortion consists in lying or in exag-gerating physical or psychological symptoms in or-
der to achieve an external goal (Eitan, 2011). Some respondents present themselves inaccu-
rately as a result of limited insight into and under-
standing of themselves."
10-5114_cipp-2019-92561.pdf,Union,"Since prior studies demonstrated that 
marital attitudes may have important consequences for behaviors, decisions, and trajectories through young adulthood (Willoughby, 2014) and that atti -
tudes toward marriage held by young adults may be 
considered to be indicators of their prospective de -
cisions in the domain of family life (Bakiera, 2009), 
the current investigation focused on the link be -
tween marital and love attitudes and young adults’ relationship status. Therefore, the present study can be seen as part of a larger body of research seeking to cast light on how young and unmarried people’s attitudes, values, and beliefs concerning marital 
transitions and relationships may change individual 
and relational behaviors (Willoughby, Hall, &  Lu -
czak, 2013). Moreover, since the number of single persons has been on the rise (e.g., Ochnik & Mandal, 2016), investigating factors contributing to the de -
velopment of stable, satisfying romantic and mari -
tal relationships in young adulthood has theoretical and practical importance for family, developmental, 
and sociological scholars studying relationships and 
marriage, as well as for family policy experts.Marital attitudes 
Marital attitudes refer to a person’s subjective opin -
ion of the institution of heterosexual marriage (Braat -
en & Rosén, 1998). As Willoughby (2014) noted, there 
is a deficit of research focusing on the issue of the influence of one’s marital attitudes on actual family formation. A similar deficit has also been observed in Poland. However, in one of the prior studies, Clarkberg, Stolzenberg, and Waite (1995) found that higher importance attached to marriage by young adults increases the likelihood of their transition into marriage or cohabitation and lowers the probability that the transition will be to a cohabiting union. Car -
roll and colleagues (2007) found that higher levels of general marital importance and priority of mar -
riage during emerging adulthood were negatively associated with emerging adults’ family formation values such as endorsement of non-marital cohabi -
tation, out-of-wedlock childbirth, and spousal inde -
pendence. Furthermore, in a  study by Willoughby (2014), lower expected age of marriage and placing more importance on marriage at the end of adoles -
cence were found to be associated with an increased likelihood of transitioning to marriage earlier than other young adults. Prior research also indicated that marital attitudes 
are predictive of later marital behavior. For example, 
spouses who did not believe that marriage should last 
forever were less likely to pool their money and were 
more likely to have extramarital affairs (Hall, 2006). Marital attitudes may be therefore considered as key mechanisms for predicting actual marital and couple formation behaviors (Bakiera, 2009; Glenn & Kramer, 1987; Hall, 2006; Willoughby, 2014)."

At the same time, although some prior empirical studies linked early marital attitudes to union formation in young adult-hood, there exist two studies directly on the issue of the connection between relationship status and mari-tal attitudes. To be precise, in a  study Willoughby, Medaris, James, and Bartholomew (2015) found that negative relationship experiences or a lack of related experience (e.g., breaking up, remaining single) were associated with a  decrease in marital salience over time, whereas remaining single was associated with increased expected marital timing. Furthermore, a  Polish study (Adamczyk &  Hall, 2014) conducted on a sample of Polish young adults showed that, in comparison to single individuals, partnered individu-als perceived marriage as the highest expression of 
love and intimacy and the most satisfying type of 
relationship to a higher degree than single individu-als. Partnered individuals also perceived marriage as a relationship perfectly fit for soul mates or believed 
that a good marriage is inherently full of agreement 
and spontaneity, and they perceived marriage as be-ing compatible with (or even promoting) maintain-ing clear individual identities.Marital and love attitudes

ed by Forsblom, Sӓrkӓmö, Laitinen, and Tervaniemi (2010), in a  study in which stroke patients listened 
to either music or audiobooks for one hour a day for 
2 months. Here, again, the group listening to music 
received better outcomes in regards to mood, relax-
ation, and motor activity. From the perspective of the importance of MT 
for lowering levels of depression in individuals who have experienced a stroke (as mentioned before, de-
pression is one of the more frequent consequences 
of stroke), it is worth mentioning research by Kim et al. (2011). Patients attended 40-minute group ses-
sions twice a  week for a  period of 4 weeks. These 
sessions started with a song and sharing experiences 
from everyday life, then various musical activities 
were performed, and at the end a goodbye song was sung and participants shared their feelings associat-
ed with the session. After the programme finished, it  
was found that levels of depression were signifi-
cantly lowered among MT participants, and that  
a lowering of levels of anxiety was on the threshold of statistical significance. Also, Van Vugt, Ritter, Roll-
nik, and Altenmüller (2014) observed lower levels of 
depression for individuals who received active MT which consisted of playing finger exercises and sim-
ple children’s songs on a piano during ten 30-min-
ute sessions. Moreover, a  decrease in the levels of 
tiredness and an increase of synchronisation during 
clapping were observed. An improvement of mood caused by active MT in the form of stretching exer-
cises with music, singing songs, and playing percus-sion instruments was observed also in a study by Jun, 
Roh, and Kim (2012), in which an increase in levels of 
shoulder and elbow joint flexion was also observed. A similar mood improvement effect, and an increase 
in arousal, was documented by Chen, Tsai, Huang,

ple mediation analyses for pain expected and experi-enced on admission (T1) and the recalled second stage 
pain (T2) were conducted. The models included per-sonality dimensions (T2) and cognitive appraisal (T1). In addition, the model for recalled second stage 
pain included actual pain experienced at T1. results
Prior to mediation analysis, descriptive statistics and simple correlations between variables (at T1 and T2) were calculated (see Table 1). Out of all the personality traits under study, only 
neuroticism and conscientiousness were associat-ed with cognitive appraisal of labor and with labor pain. Neuroticism was positively correlated with threat/loss appraisal and increased pain (at T1 and T2), while conscientiousness correlated with more marked challenge appraisal and less threat/loss (T1) and increased second stage labor pain recall (at T2). Expected pain (at T1) was correlated only with cog-nitive appraisals of either type (challenge and threat/
loss), but was not correlated with personality traits, 
and was therefore excluded from further analysis. A one-way analysis of variance for repeated mea-
sures indicated that labor pain perceived at T1 and T2 (Table 1) differed significantly, Wilks’ λ F(1, 43) = 6.92,  
p = .012. Moreover, pain experienced in the first 
stage of labor (T1) and recalled second stage labor pain (T2) were significantly more intense than the  
expected pain, Wilks’ λ F(1, 43) = 178.67, p < .001, and  
Wilks’ λ F(1, 43) = 206.55, p < .001, respectively. Significance of sociodemographic variables for 
dependent variables was also tested: none of the sub-sidiary variables such as age, education level (0 – pri-mary/vocational education, 1 – college/university), marital status, number or previous births (0 – prim-iparous women, 1 – multiparous women), or natural 
childbirth/cesarean section

on either the experienced (at T1), expected (at T1) or

In the first step, differences were compared in the 
children’s attribution of traits related to the success and health behaviors of women and men of different silhouettes. For this purpose, multiple paired samples test statistics were used. As can be seen in Table 2, the examined children most often associated traits related to the success of women and men with nor-mal body structure, and least often with people with obese body shape. Children most often attributed pro-health behaviors to slim women and slim men, and again and least often to people with obese body shape. In the case of anti-health behaviors, signifi-cant differences were noted only between obese and slim and obese and normal silhouettes – children did not notice differences in the attribution of anti-health behaviors in the case of people with slim and normal body shape. While conducting the study, it caught researchers’ 
attention that ‘running’ was relatively often associat-ed with a silhouette of an obese woman. Researchers wrote down all the children’s comments and a com-ment that “fat people have to run to lose weight’ was recorded several times. In the next step, it was verified whether the per-
ception of success and health behaviors of people with different body shapes is different for women and men. For this purpose, paired samples test statis-tics were used. As can be seen in Table 3, significant differences were noted in the children’s attribution of success to women and men who have a slim build:

titudes of 5/6 year olds translate into the levels of adequacy of the emerging image of their own body two years later. The Beauty & Health scale has been used to in-
vestigate the relationship between gender stereo-types and body image. As one of the components of 
gender stereotypes concerns female beauty, we want 
to verify the hypothesis that the standards of beauty and intensity of stereotypical body perception held by five-year-olds are determined by parental atti-tudes towards gender relations and gender stereo-typization. Initial analyses revealed that 5/6-year-old girls and boys equally associate social success with a normal body shape and almost never with an obese one. Ambivalent sexism was higher among fathers than mothers, regardless of the child’s sex. Mothers’ ASI score was strongly related to daughters associat-ing happiness with normal female body shape, be-ing clever with being obese in females, and having the highest number of friends was considered to be a feature of men with normal body shape. Also the more benevolent the mother, the more often girls associated being rich with obese men. Additionally, the obese women were considered to be most clever by girls whose fathers had the highest hostile sexism results. In the case of sons, they saw obese women and men as professionally fulfilled when their fa-ther’s sexism was the lowest. Also, obese men were seen as the nicest when mother’s hostile sexism and father’s benevolent sexism were lowest. Our results show a strong relationship between parents’ sexism and children’s stereotypes about body size (Lipow-ska, Lipowski, & Kosakowska-Berezecka, 2016)."
10-5114_hpr-2018-75860.pdf,Associat,"Longitudinal studies (Alajbeg, Gikić, & Valentić-Pe-
ruzović, 2014) showed that the health-related quality of life of patients with masticatory organ dysfunc-
tions, who suffer from myofascial pain, show regu-
lar improvement during stabilisation splint therapy 
– at least during the six-month period included in 
the study observations. Reduced intensity of pain to-gether with better ability to open the mouth wider 
transpired to be an important factor determining im-
provement in the quality of life. Interestingly, the ini-
tial level of pain experienced, measured by the quan-
titative VAS scale, does not seem, in this context, to be an important factor, and nor were age or duration 
of dysfunction (Oliveira et al., 2003a, 2003b). Another longitudinal study, covering a period of 
six months (Reisine & Weber, 1989), showed that al-
though the measured level of pain experienced by patients reduced over time, functional aspects, and 
those associated with oral cavity health, did not un-
dergo substantial improvement. This difference may 
be due to the relatively slow response of these pa-
rameters to the process of treatment, in contrast to the relatively fast response of pain. The same authors 
also described a relatively low estimation of well-be-
ing and high estimation of anxiety, which might in-dicate the psychological characteristics of this group 
of patients, as well as the interesting observation 
that persistent experiences of pain (even if there was 
a significant reduction of the symptoms) are associat-
ed with the lack of improvement in perceived quality of life. At the same time, there were no significant 
differences in symptoms of social isolation compared 
to the group of healthy subjects, indicating that these 
patients do not show problems related to the social 
sphere. However, other authors argue that social dis-orders are secondary to the unresolved disorders of 
a dental nature (Oliveira et al., 2003b). In view of the above few empirical reports, the 
purpose of this study was to acquire broader knowl-
edge of the specifics of the health-related quality of life among patients with muscle-related masticatory organ dysfunctions, with particular emphasis on the characteristics of experienced pain. Considerations about pain were extended to include its localisation and quality characteristics, which have not been ad-
dressed yet in the available publications dedicated to 
patients suffering from masticatory organ dysfunc-tions, and what the authors considered an important 
complement to the analysed issue. Thus, the study 
attempted to answer two key research questions:

33 volume 7(1), 9Background
In the last decade, Polish research has seldom dis-
cussed the issue of psychological resilience and body image as significant psychological variables with 
a  considerable impact on the functioning of post-
mastectomy women. However, results of scientific 
studies dedicated to the subject of this article may 
serve as a significant source of knowledge support-
ing treatment and recovery of women suffering from 
breast cancer. Both Polish and foreign statistics con-
firm a rise in breast cancer among women. In 2008, 
over 330,000 women were diagnosed with breast can-cer in the European Union member states. In 2013, the incidence of malignant breast cancer in women 
was over 17,000 in Poland (the Polish National Can-
cer Registry, 2013). According to forecasts for the 
years 2010–2025, the breast cancer incidence rate is 
expected to rise from 44 per hundred thousand popu-
lation by 2006 to 60 per hundred thousand popula-
tion by 2025. The forecast breast cancer incidence in women for 2025 is over 50.00% higher than in 2006 
(Meder, 2014). Both suffering from cancer and undergoing sur-
gery (in this case, mastectomy) are undoubtedly 
considered difficult situations in psychology. Both situations involve occurrence of traumatic events in 
a person’s life."

The ability to communicate one’s beliefs and knowl -
edge in both spoken (oracy) and written (literacy) form 
constitutes a prerequisite for an active citizenship. Ed-
ucation and Training 2020  strategy (cf. Eurydice, 2005) 
encourages learners based in the European Union to learn 2 foreign languages (FL), in addition to their 
own native language (NL). Achieving proficiency in 
writing in a particular language might be especially challenging for students with dyslexia. In fact, they 
manifest difficulties in both their NL (ICD-10, 2000; Lyon, Shaywitz, &  Shaywitz, 2003) and EFL (Eng -
lish as a  foreign language) in: spelling (Łockiewicz & Jaskulska, 2016; Helland & Kaasa, 2005; Lindgren 
& Laine, 2011), free writing (Lindgren & Laine, 2011) 
and morphology tasks (Helland & Kaasa, 2005). These 
reports relate to the linguistic transfer of capabilities and deficits between NL (native language) and FL 
(foreign language) (Cummins, 1979; Sparks, Patton, 
Ganschow, Humbach, & Javorsky, 2006). Both long-term (Perfetti, 2007) and short-term 
(Nevo &  Breznitz, 2014; Rispens &  Baker, 2012) 
memory are needed for writing skills and FL learn -
ing (Woźnicki & Zawadzka, 1981), though the signifi -
cance of the former increases and the latter decreas -
es when learning new FL words with the growing mental dictionary (Masoura &  Gathercole, 2005). However, lexicon access requires the involvement of 
short-term memory (Piskunowicz, Bieliński, Zgliński, 
& Borkowska, 2013)."

selected from an age cohort (Mage = 15.96, SD = 0.30)

Physical Activity Objectives (IPAO; Lipowski & Za-

– teenagers who are exempt from PA classes and did not report taking part in self-organised PA; 2) a PE 
group, n = 514 (322 girls) – teenagers who only do 
PA in school (physical education class); 3) a high PA 
group, n = 178 (81 girls) – teenagers who participate in PE classes and are also physically active (PA) by 
themselves (not involved in any organized forms of PA), engaging in physical activity for at least 60 min, 4 to 7 days a week (hours a week devoted to training: M = 10.69, SD = 5.78); and 4) an athlete group, n = 135

Schools were randomly selected (10 of 12 sport schools and 25 of 381 general education schools) from the 
Pomeranian Office of Education database. Complete 
data were obtained from 35% of students from general 
schools and 45% of students from sport schools. All participants and their parents gave informed

in five children were being brought up in such fami -
lies). However, it is worth noting that the number of families in which fathers are single parents is grow -
ing dynamically (cf. Szredzińska, 2017). Today’s single 
parents are often well-off individuals who, as one may 
assume, often consciously choose lone parenthood. However, the second group of single parents is still made up of people in difficult economic and living 
conditions, such as unmarried women abandoned by 
the fathers of their children (Sikorska, 2009). After Poland’s accession to the European Union, 
the number of labour migrations increased, includ-ing in the case of individuals bringing up children. More families chose the option of one parent leaving 
their children in Poland under the care of the other 
parent. Research conducted in 2014 on behalf of the 
Polish Children’s Rights Ombudsman shows that about 20% of children aged 10-19 experienced tem-
porary separation from at least one parent, with the 
father (68% of children) leaving more often than the 
mother (14.8% of children). Periodic absence of both 
parents due to economic migration was experienced by 17.2% of children from this group. The purpose 
of the parents’ travel was of course to improve the 
living conditions of their families, but it had a nega-
tive impact on the sense of security of their children, 
weakening the bonds between the spouses and the relationship between the absent parent and the child. In families separated due to migration, educational 
problems were also more common (Tarka, 2014)."

sion is in line with a study by Alladi et al. (2016), who found that post-stroke, cognitive functions remain intact considerably more often in bilinguals than in 
monolinguals (with the exception of aphasia). Thus, 
our findings support the broad thesis that bilingual -
ism, as well as intensive new/second language learn -
ing, may protect one from the development of some post-stroke cognitive impairments (Alladi et al., 2016) and in ageing healthy elderly people may, for exam -
ple, delay the onset of dementia symptoms (Bak, Long, Vega-Mendoza, & Sorace, 2016; Bialystok, Abutalebi, Bak, Burke, & Kroll, 2016). In sum, our findings shed 
new light not only on the functional organization of 
the bilingual brain, but also on general mechanisms of brain plasticity and emphasize even more the poten -
tial of non-native language learning for brain health and neurorehabilitation. acknowledgments

is “more beneficial” for men than it is for women. Married men are physically and mentally healthier as 
well as more satisfied with life than single ones. Also 
Myers (1999) is of the opinion that it is men rather 
than women who gain more by getting married. This 
relationship is not found in the case of women, for whom the quality of marriage rather than simply being married is associated with the experience of happiness (Gove, 1972; Czapiński, 2008). It has been found that the relationship between marital satisfac-tion and general psychological well-being is much stronger in women than in men (Baruch & Burnett, 1986; Proulx, Helms, & Buehler, 2007).

Contemporary young people often point out that 
career and personal development opportunities are 
greater when one has not made stable marital and family commitments (Pillsworth &  Haselton, 2005; Żurek, 2008; Czernecka, 2011). Consequently, in the context of debates concern-
ing the significance of being in a close intimate re-lationship for the sense of happiness and well-being in individuals in emerging and early adulthood, it is worth reflecting on the phenomenon of singlehood, 
which is becoming increasingly widespread nowa-
days. If, as the cited studies show, being in a stable 
intimate relationship is so significant for a person’s 
quality of life and sense of happiness, particularly at 
the threshold of adulthood and in early adulthood, 
then the following question can be asked: how do Intimate

ple who do not build such relationships and remain

well-being, or are they less happy? Given that the ability to find a partner and build 
a stable intimate relationship is often treated as a cri -
terion of becoming an adult and a criterion of devel -
opment in early adulthood (Havighurst, 1953; Erik -
son, 2004; Arnett, 2000; Seiffge-Krenke, 2003), one 
may wonder if taking on this task and satisfaction 
with its achievement can be of any significance for a person’s sense of happiness and well-being."

Clubs for people with mental illness experience (for -
merly referred to as the “Patient’s Clubs”) are in Poland 
one of the most popular forms of support programmes. The  Clubs are often perceived as establishments with 
a  poorly structured programme, offering only the  op -
portunity to spend leisure time without having to engage 
in intensive activation and training activities. Y et, par -
ticipation in the Clubs is effectively supporting the re -
covery process [1, 2]. Ensuring access to social contacts 
and attractive activities is of  paramount importance 
here [3, 4]. The studies show that it is mainly these two 
elements of the Clubs’ programmes that motivate peo -
ple to attend these Clubs [5]. Participation in the Club 
may thus make it possible to end the  isolation caused 
by social exclusion attitudes and to ease the symptoms 
of the disease [6]. Therefore, the Clubs can be perceived 
as a  convenient place to do something attractive and 
have a good time, avoiding the atmosphere of a ‘thera -
peutic centre’ , focused on the symptoms and treatment 
of the disease [7]. In Poland, the Clubs are usually open in the afternoon. They are located in psychiatric institutions (e.g. in day-
care wards) or community support centres (Communi -
ty Self-help Centres and Occupational Therapy Work -
shops). Activities are performed when the establishments 
end their day work."

the number of hours of weekly Internet use, they are also 
significant predictors, enabling primarily the prediction 
of membership to the group of persons with a  lower  level 
of problematic Internet use. Lower results on the afore -
mentioned subscales of the Need for Closure Scale were 
associated with higher levels of problematic Internet use, 
as were greater numbers of hours of weekly Internet use. It should be noted that persons with a  higher  lev-
el of Closed-mindedness are motivated to resist or ig -
nore information conflicting with their existing beliefs 
but rely on expected categories. This is also linked to 
resistance to new ideas and experiences, and thus to re -
sistance to change [51]. Chernikova et al . [52] showed that a higher level of Closed-mindedness was associat -
ed with stronger anxiety towards new technologies and 
lower willingness to use them. Thus, persons with  this 
type of  epistemic motivation avoid contact with new 
technologies, and for this reason  may exhibit lower 
levels of  dysfunctional behavior  connected with such 
technologies. Moreover, Closed-mindedness is linked 
to lower creativity and greater preference for the values 
of conformity and tradition [53]. In this sense, conform -
ity relates to the suppression of one’s actions, goals, and 
impulses that might harm or annoy other people or vio -
late social expectations and norms. Tradition as a value 
relates to the acceptance and maintenance of customs, 
ideas, and the traditions of one’s own culture, religion 
or family; also to the respect shown  towards tradition. In addition, this type of  motivation is associated with 
a lower preference for the value known as self-direction, 
namely independence in thought, action and choices, 
creativity and freedom [54]."

types are reported for American s ociety (Brooks, 2014; D o-
lan, 2014). However, little known about political contexts 
other than that of the United States and its relation to pe r-
ceptions of women and men in politics. The post -
communist context sets the specific conditions in relation 
both t o gender stereotypes and to scandal perception. Al t-
hough the former communist system did not discriminate 
against women in their professional careers, the actual nu m-
ber of women in politics was rather low and they were not 
encouraged in the political arena  (Siemieńska, 1994). Cu r-
rently, their political representation is similar to that reported 
in democratic cou ntries without a communist past. For i n-
stance, women make up 24.35% of members in the Polish 
parliament and they a lso represent 19.35% of those in the  
U.S. Congress (Inter -parliamentary Union, 2015). The more 
serious differences are visible in perceptions of political sy s-
tems. In post -communist countries, trust toward politicians 
is low and p olitical class is perceived as dishonest and co r-
rupted (Johnso n, 2005; Puchalska, 2005). For this reason, 
the standards for evaluation of politicians’ honesty could be 
lower than in e stablished democracies, regardless a politician 
sex. The current study  
 
The primary purpose of this research is to examine ind i-
viduals ’ perceptions of politicians involved in scandals and 
whether they differ based on the type of scandal and/or the 
politicians’ sex. Currently, research on the impact of polit i-
cian sex and misconduct offers inconsistent findings, pote n-
tially due to the lack  of diverse samples, lack of control for 
level of prejudice, and lack of control for severity in scandal Corruption and Sexual Scandal: The Importance of Politician Gender                                                                                           135

used the shorter , 10-item version of the original self -
construal scale (Singelis, 1994) to assess self -construal (e.g., 
“My happiness depends on the happiness of those closest to me,” “ I behave the same way no matter who I am with ” for 
the interdependent self and the independent self , respective-
ly). Participants responded using  a 7-point scale (1 = strongly 
disagree  to 7 = strongly agree ). Cronbach’s α was .54 for the in-
terdependent self -construal and .62 for the independent self -
construal. Identity fusion . To assess the level of fusion between 
personal and group identity, I used the seven -item identity 
fusion scale (Gómez et al., 2011b ) and measured f usion with 
the groups provided by participants (e.g ., sports  club, reli-
gious group, coworkers, nongovernment organization ; sam-
ple item : “I feel one with my group”). Participants responded 
using  a 7-point scale (1 = strongly disagree  to 7 = strongly agree ). Reliability was measured with Cronbach’s α, which equaled 
.89. Results and discussion  
 
Preliminary analyses. The average  result for identity 
fusion was 4.70 (SD = 0.93). Preliminary correlation analyses 
showed that all variables were correlated, except for the rela-
tion between the independent an d interdependent self -
construals."
